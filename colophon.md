### Desktop Software

I edit the site on an Ubuntu desktop machine using Atom or Visual Studio Code. I use [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) for image editing as well as some [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for processing.

### Personal

I am an American living outside London. I am married and have two grown children. I have been working on the web since 1995 doing everything from design to coding, but mostly as a Product Manager/Managing Editor/Head of Web.

I am very interested in clean, simple, web-standard information design and try to bring that to every place I work.
