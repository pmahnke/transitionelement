<h2>Thailand</h2>
<b>BANGKOK <i>DAY 2</i></b><br>
HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY<p>

The next day we went on a day walk of the old town across the river.  You take these express boats on the river for like 2 cents to travel as far as you want.  We feed turtles papaya at a monastery grave yard, saw Dutch style homes, a European church, a famous temple (called Wat) called Wat Chedi and another across the river called Wat Po with a 150 foot reclining Buddha.  Angela got a 1/2 traditional Thai massage, I got a new sexy Thai massage (just kidding).<p>

That night we went to an awesome, expensive for Thailand ($19) dinner in downtown and then we went to Patpong.... the seediest street with all the sex shows.  I personally wanted to go in and see "PUSSY EATING WITH CHOPSTICKS" but Angela made me buy 2 ripped off polo shirts at the night market in the middle of the Patpong..... the night market was the excuse 90% of the people used to see Patpong, but the sex trade is all over Thailand and there are a LOT of single western men touring.<p>
