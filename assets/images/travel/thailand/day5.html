HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY<p>

We got picked up early and drove out to an elephant training camp.  We paid for a 1 hour ride on an elephant, which was wonderful and the scariest thing I have ever done.  Its muddy from rain and they make this elephant climb up and down 45 degree inclines with 3 people. We kept thinking it was going to go over ass over tea kettle...... and crush us comically into the deep mud.<p>

They also had a show that showed how elephants were used in the Teak plantations that made Thailand famous (no more forestry, they are ecologically very protective in Thailand).<p>

Then a Wat with 2,000 stairs up a mountain.  It was amazing, the Wat was so nice and the views of Chaing Mai below and the mountains was wonderful.<p>

We then got dropped off in town and ate lunch at a wonderful place that also sold deep fried insects (we did not partake).<p>

That night we went to the town's night market and another nice restaurant on the river and had fish....<p>

Then to a pub for the world cup (huge there) and beerssss..... we drank lots of nice Thai beer and more than 8 litters of water a day because it was sooo HOT.<p>
