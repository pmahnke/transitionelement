<p>Loved this book. Unfortunately it doesnâ€™t appear to be in print anymore. Angela got it via a complicated library requested that started with a book I read, Stet. We both loved it. It predates the uber-rich players of today, but still, a kid from the bottom rung of life makes it all the way and then falls back down again. Amazingly well told.</p>

<p>Michael Irwin deserved far more recognition for this book that he got. Read it if you can find it!</p>
