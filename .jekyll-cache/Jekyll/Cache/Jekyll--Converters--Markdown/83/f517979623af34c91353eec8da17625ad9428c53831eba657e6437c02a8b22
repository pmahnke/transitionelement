<p>I knew this day would come since 17 February 2011, when I was told about the overall budget and the detail that my team’s budget was actually going to be cut the deepest in the company. It has been the hardest six weeks in my working life; keeping everything moving, fighting for more of my team to stay, hiding my upset from my team. At one point I seriously ran the risk of having to let go, not one, but two partners (one married and one engaged) on the team – 100% income loss for each family - luckily, I think one person will be saved.</p>

<p>In my heart, I knew I should have left the company nearly two years ago. Ever since my last boss, the very excellent Kate Wilson left the company.</p>
