<p><em>by New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Vintage</em></p>

<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>

<div class="book_synopsis">
Synopsis: <em>Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school, the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather, there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man's first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand. Challenging and surprising, this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.</em>

<p>Thought provoking, well researched, hopefully transformative, this book tries to set the record straight on what the ‘new’ world was live before and shortly after the ‘old’ world arrived. I learned much. If there was a flaw, the book didn’t spend enough time explaining what happened after 1491. Luckily there is a second book, 1493 to explain all.</p>
