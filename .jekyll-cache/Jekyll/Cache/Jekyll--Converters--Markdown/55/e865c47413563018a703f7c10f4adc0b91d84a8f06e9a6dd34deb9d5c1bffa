<p><em>by (Jack Reacher 15)</em></p>

<p>Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</p>

<div class="book_synopsis">
Synopsis: <em>Initially, we are not told how Jack Reacher survived the seemingly-terminal events of the last book, as he makes his way south to an unwelcoming part of Nebraska in the dead of winter. He fetches up in a town in the grip of the powerful, manipulative Duncan family, and the cowed townspeople have no fight left in them. In a sleazy hotel, he encounters the town's alcoholic doctor, and the two end up driving to a house where they come across a grim case of domestic violence. And Child admirers won't be surprised to learn that Jack's life is soon on the line -- as usual. The stage is set for violent confrontation.

&lt;/div&gt;
A better Reacher novel than some, a bit formulaic, but very well written again. It is what you expect and want.

Great escape.
