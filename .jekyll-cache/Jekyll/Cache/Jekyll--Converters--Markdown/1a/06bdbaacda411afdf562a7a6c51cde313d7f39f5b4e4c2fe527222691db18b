I"ä<p>For years, every month or so, we have been going over to Ham on a Saturday morning to the <a href="http://www.backhaus.co.uk/">Backhaus German Bakers</a> for rolls (Broetchen) and liverwurst. We also usually get a Bretzel and Rhubarb or Poppy seed cake. Some days are better than others, but it is always a treat. The rolls and liverwurst are <em>far</em> superiour to anything we have found in a British shop. Not to put down British bread, we love that, but rolls. Sorry, no</p>
