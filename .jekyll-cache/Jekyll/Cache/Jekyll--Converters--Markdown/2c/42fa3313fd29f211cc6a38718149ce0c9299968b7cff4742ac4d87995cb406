I"<p>Today I did some general CPAN update. Everything went fine, I thought, but when I attempted to publish a post to this blog with Movable Type 3.38, I kept getting this error:</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
An error occurred:
Global symbol “$nested” requires explicit package name at (re_eval 34) line 2, &lt;DATA&gt; line 1.
Compilation failed in regexp at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/SelfLoader.pm line 112, &lt;DATA&gt; line 1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>After a minor amount of digging, I found it was either SelfLoader.pm or Textile2.</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
perl -MSelfLoader -e ‘print 1’
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>returned ‘1’</p>

<p>I attempted to upgrade to the MT 4.X versions of textile2, but MT 3 didn’t recognise it at all.</p>

<p>So, I just added …</p>

<p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
my $nested = “”;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>… to SelfLoader.pm and it works.</p>

<p>Who knows if that will cause other errors later, but it all works now.</p>

<p>Hope this might help someone else.</p>
