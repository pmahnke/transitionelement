<p>I have had these Sansom books sitting on my shelf for a year now and was only vaguely interested in reading them. However, my mother and friends Ann and Paul encouraged me to try them. Wow, they are amazing.</p>

<p>Historical fiction at its very best, I cannot recommend these enough – great characters, interesting history, fascinating mystery.</p>
