<p>I love <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-GB/more/features.html">Google Chrome</a>. It has just introduced a new super-fast page loading feature called <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/06/prerendering-in-chrome.html">Prerendering</a> that tries to guess what you are looking for and gets it in the background. It is really fast. However, if you type a bit slow, it does have a tendency to just try and get whatever bit of the url you have typed.</p>

<p>For example, I was trying to go to <a href="http://www4.scholastic.co.uk/warehousesale">www4.scholastic.co.uk/warehousesale</a> and happened to be tailing the error log and found this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;code&gt;
[Wed Jun 22 12:41:47 2011] [error] File does not exist: /var/www/html/warehousesal
&gt;&gt;[Wed Jun 22 12:41:48 2011] [error] File does not exist: /var/www/html/warehou
&gt;[Wed Jun 22 12:41:48 2011] [error] File does not exist: /var/www/html/wareho
[Wed Jun 22 12:41:48 2011] [error] File does not exist: /var/www/html/wa
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, this single request really didnâ€™t take too much time or CPU, but I can imagine, with loads of people moving to Chrome, this could really start adding up to real CPU and network bandwidth.</p>

<p>What do other people think?</p>
