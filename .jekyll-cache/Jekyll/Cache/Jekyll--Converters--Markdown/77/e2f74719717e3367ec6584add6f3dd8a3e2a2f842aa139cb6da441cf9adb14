<p>Well, I loved books one and two. This was really pretty good, except for the last 100 pages or soâ€¦ really from the point they entered the underground and headed for the Presidentâ€™s mansion. (Potential spoilerâ€¦) I didnâ€™t see the point of all the deaths to the mutts underground, seemed like they were just paring back peopleâ€¦ for no good reason. I also donâ€™t know why Prim had to show up either, or for it to go into â€˜morphlingâ€™ modeâ€¦ with the explosions. Since it is for Young Adults, why not let the three walk into a deserted mansion and find Snow and just let them be heros? Just seemed either rushed or confused.</p>
