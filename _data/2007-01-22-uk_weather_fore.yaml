    <p>and here i thought aussie weather was crap.</p>  <p>aussie tv weather is BAD where the most informative forecast will say &#39;becoming fine high 25 low 15 southeasternly winds&#39;.  no humidity. no allergens.  no &#39;feels like&#39;.  not even a UV level when there&#39;s like no ozone here.</p>  <p>online is better - <a href="http://abc.net.au/melbourne/weather/">abc</a> has humidity, wind &amp; even probability of rain. the authorities are <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDV10450.shtml">bom</a> (does no one else find it funny a gov agency - bureau of meteorology is called bom?) give you a lot of what&#39;s happened, some <a href="http://mirror.bom.gov.au/products/IDR023.shtml">radar</a> &amp; satellite but the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDV10450.shtml">forecast</a> is pretty lame especially if you&#39;re looking for a few days in advance.</p>  <p>though it does seem to be a better than what you&#39;ve screen shotted. :)</p>

    <p>OMG! (in the words of my daughters generation).  you have just told me exactly what I&#39;ve noticed over the last 6 months.  I moved from Houston, TX to Walton on Thames, UK about 6 months ago.  The weather forecasting here vs there is very different.  As an example, please load up weather.com (not weather.co.uk) and type in 77002 (Houston post code).   now go to the radar for houston.  compare that with what you get for anywhere in England.  where is the detail?</p>  <p>of all the adjustments, besides driving on the left side with no real road signs, that&#39;s probably the biggest adjustment for my wife and I.</p>
