    <p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts about kids&#39; books... we are bigtime readers and always looking for interesting additions.  Have to take issue w/ your inclusion of Richard Scary, though... much as kids may love him, don&#39;t the completely calcified gender roles bug you after a while?  Sheesh.</p>

    <p>Shelley,</p>  <p>I agree, but give him allowences for writting in 40+ years ago...</p>  <p>However, other than Huckle Cat, where there is no father at all, just a Bavarian wonderland, I can&#39;t stand any of the books... they are mind-numbingly repeative.  Its just that my kids like them for some reason...</p>  <p>Peter</p>
