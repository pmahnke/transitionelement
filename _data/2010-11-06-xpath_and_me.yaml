    <p>A while back I found Java library called JTidy (also named HTMLTidy maybe) which cleans badly-formed HTML into a DOM which can then be selected using XPath.  Possibly there is a Perl equivalent. I used it to scrape a daily cartoon strip image from the publishers graphics-laden website onto a personal intranet page ;)</p>
