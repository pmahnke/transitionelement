p. _Flight delayed nine hours..._

p. When we arrived at Heathrow the plane so delayed that they wouldn't even check us in -- might not even be a flight at all.

p. Two hours later we learned there was a problem with the aircraft and a different plane was coming, but four hours late -- *at 10pm* -- with no information on our connection to Fez.

p. Finally at 11pm we took off and arrived at 1:30am.  Then after a painfully confusing negotiation with the airline staff of about 30 minutes, they finally took about 60 of us to a hotel in downtown Casablanca for the night -- another 30 minutes away.  We were finally asleep by 3:30am or so -- headed to 2 1/2 hours of sleep -- nice.
