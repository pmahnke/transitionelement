h2. Day 2 - Casablanca to Fez

p. _Saturday, 11 September 2004_

After a painful 6am wake-up call, a quick shower and a crappy breakfast, we climb back on our bus and head back to the airport.  We have to walk all over the airport to get our new tickets, re-check our luggage, find the right security and gate and get the bus to the plane.  Finally we arrive in Fez at 10am.

Our hotel arranged a ride (at great cost) from the airport to the hotel -- "Riad Maison Bleue":http://www.maisonbleue.com/rmb/en/index.html.  Its a lovely old riad on the edge of the medina.  We sat in the wonderful open courtyard, sipping mint tea while checking in and getting our rooms together.

The riad, which only has a handful of rooms, has a concierge, who was a pleasant fellow who arrange for a guide for us and dinner that evening at the Maison Bleue -- the sister to our riad.  Then we ran up to the room and cleaned up a bit and took a needed two hour nap.  The room was lovely and traditional with tile floors and walls up to about four feet, then some delicate plaster work.  Nice rugs on the floors and windows onto the courtyard.  We also had a door right onto their roof-deck for breakfast and little breaks.

After the nap we met Johal, our guide for the next day and a half.  He was nice enough, spoke good English, but didn't exactly burn our ears with information about the anything really.  However, he did sit down and make sure that the time we had would be doing the things we wanted.

For the afternoon, as it was pretty quiet, we decided to just wander through the Medina and get a sense of it all.

The medina is ancient, built in a bowl and completely twisted with narrow streets and alleys -- apparently done prior to the concept of getting tourists lost.  We really needed Johal to lead us around.  I couldn't even see where the sun was to orient myself, without him, we would still be in there.  We stopped at two museums; the *Mus&#233;e Nejjarine Des Arts Et M&#233;tiers Du Bois* and *Karim Lamrani*, an old medersa (school) that is no longer used.

The *Mus&#233;e Nejjarine Des Arts Et M&#233;tiers Du Bois* (or Museum of Wood, as I like to say) was very nice.  The building is excellent.  It used to be a trading house on the ground floor and an inn on the upper floors.  They have a lovely roof-top with caf&#233; -- but it was far to hot to stay when we were there.

In the Karim Lamrani Medersa, you can only see the main courtyard and praying area.  It has lovely Italian marble columns, tiled floor and walls, delicate plaster and cedar second floor.  In the center of the open couryard was a really pretty pool.

After some more wandering, we headed back to the Riad for some drinks on the roof-top terrace.

At 6:30pm we walked over to the Maison Bleue for drinks on their roof-top.  We got there a little to late to see the sun setting, but in the twilight, had a lovely view of the medina.  However there was a steady 30 knot breeze to keep us cool and the drinks rattling on the table.  We went down to dinner at 8:30pm and two people we met, one on the plane today and one on the trip from London, joined us for dinner (a little strange -- but enjoyable).  We had a lovely meal of:

* _Moroccan Salad_ of cooked eggplant, zuchini, lentils, potatoes, red petters, carrots, cucumber -- all served in separate bowls
* _Pastillia_ (filo stuffed pastry) of pigeon, nuts and dried fruit that was both sweet and savory
* _Tangine_ of chicken in a liver sauce
* _Pastillia_ with cream, honey and nuts
* _Oranges_ with cinnamon
* _Mint Tea_

Then they called us a "petite taxi" (one for intra-city trips) and we passed out in a lovely sleep.
