h2. Day 3 - Fez

p. _Sunday, 12 September 2004_

Today we had a lovely breakfast on the roof-top terrace of the Riad and met Johal at 9am.  We first drove to a fort overlooking the old city that was being rebuild to become a tourist desintation.  Currently its pretty hard to get to and pretty run down.  The views were pretty nice to give a sense of the place, but nothing really pretty to look at.

Then we went to a ceramic factory outside of town where they make all kinds of tiles, pottery and mosaic tables by hand.  They fired the kilns with ground up olive pits, which we had never seen before.

Of course the mosaic tables were too much for us to resist.  We ended up walking around for about an hour and finally decided to buy a one meter round one with a "spider" pattern.  It was cheap compared to the ones we have seen in London, but let's see what happens with the costs after duty at Heathrow.

Then we went back to the medina.
