Southern Italy & Sicily
=======================

Day 14 - Palermo to London via Naples
-------------------------------------

*Friday, 16 April 2004*

We woke up early as we arrive in Naples… too early to see the town and
just enough time to drive to the airport and go home. I have to admit, I
didn’t like the idea of the boat initially, but it worked perfectly and
saved having to stay in a hotel near the airport.

I would definitely do the entire trip again, specially with more time in
Sicily. What a lovely place.

A great trip overall!
