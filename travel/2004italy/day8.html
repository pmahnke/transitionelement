h2. Day 8 - Sorrento & Pompeii

p. _Friday, 9 April 2004_

p. Again, to avoid the traffic and the car, we opted for the light rail to Pompeii.  The station is a mere 100 meters from the entrance, so it was a extremely cheap and stress free way of getting there.  Unfortunately, it was drizzling (eng. _spitting_) with rain the whole time.

p. Learing a thing or two from the Coluseum tour, I got the kids audo guides.  _One each this time,_ and boy did it do the trick... their interest in pressing the buttons lasted for hours.  They even had a kids version, which I have to say, was nearly more interesting than the adult version.

p. My impressions of Pompeii -- well its huge.  You really are walking around a large town, down old streets, into homes, into theatres, parks and shops.  It makes all other ruins seem like a facade compared to this as nothing has been transformed into a living city.  We could have spent days poking around I think.  One full day was not enough.

Today was also Good Friday and the day of the *Morte di Cristo* parade in Sorrento.  After sunset we headed down to the town and found a great place to stand and see the dead (wooden) body of Christ taken by us.  The boys didn't really know what was going on, but the music was amazing, all dirges and the societies and churches all participated in the spectacle, bringing statues from their churches depicting the death of Christ and the sorrow of the Virgin by.  Quite moving.
