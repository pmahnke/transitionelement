h2. Day 6 - Sorrento & Isle of Capri

p. _Wednesday, 7 April 2004_

p. Bright and early we head down to the Marina Piccolo and the ferries to Capri.  After figuring out the poorly marked boat signs, we get the hydrofoil over.  Its only about an hour, but the waves were about eight foot rollers.  About 1/2 way through, Owen started to show real sings of sea sickness.  The crew were handing out bags, just in case -- we took two.

p. Poor Owen didn't really even know what was happening to him and couldn't really explain it.  I just picked him up and took him outside and played games with him to pick out things on the shore.  He was fine after that.

p. However, the waves also prevented the boats from going to the Blue Grotto, the real and only reason that we went.  Angela noticed right away that all the boats were in harbor, I didn't believe it until the man in charge gave me the sign language for waves... doh.

p. So we decided to join a local man giving a bus tour of Anacapri and Capri.  He was useless, but it got us up and down.

p. Anacapri is the "other" town on Capri, at the top of the island really.  There is nothing there but a shopping center, some restaurants, a ski lift to get a view and a walk... to get a view.  We choose the walk.  Some lovely homes, but the real reason to go are the views of the rest of the island.  We spent a good 40 minutes just looking out over the bay.  We could even see Naples and Mount Vesuvius, albeit a little fogged in.

p. Ryan was climbing up and looking in these drainage holes.  Loads of other tourists couldn't resist asking him what he was looking at, where he replied "*NOTHING, ITS JUST A HOLE*."  Most also touched his hair and about five people took pictures.

p. We had lunch in a pizza place and then headed down to Capri.  Wow, talk about upscale.  All very fancy shops that you could see in London, New York, Rome, Paris, etc... not quaint at all.  We did a quick loop and headed back.

p. The boat back was much better for waves and for Owen.
