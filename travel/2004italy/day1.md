## Day 1 - London to Rome

_Friday, 2 April 2004_

Flight delayed one hour.

Push chair missed the flight, even though we told the staff that we could still see it waiting three times.

Missed the last train to the city, had to take a taxi.

Got to Hotel Richmond (funny that we live next to Richmond in London) at 11:30pm, boys held up really well.

_Sleep._
