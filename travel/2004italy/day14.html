h2. Day 14 - Palermo to London via Naples

p. _Friday, 16 April 2004_


We woke up early as we arrive in Naples... too early to see the town and just enough time to drive to the airport and go home.  I have to admit, I didn't like the idea of the boat initially, but it worked perfectly and saved having to stay in a hotel near the airport.

I would definitely do the entire trip again, specially with more time in Sicily.  What a lovely place.

A great trip overall!
