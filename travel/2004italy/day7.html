h1(title). Southern Italy & Sicily

h2. Day 7 - Sorrento & The Amalfi Coast

p. _Thursday, 8 April 2004_

p. After seeing the roads and parking issues that we would experience on the other side of the Sorrento Peninsula, the Amalfi Coast, we decided to take a bus to Amalfi and Positano.  Owen nearly got ill on the bus, but we all loved the views of the mountains falling away into the Mediterranean.

p. Our first stop was the lovely town of Amalfi.  We decided to let the kids play on the beach for a good hour before exploring the town.

p. The town wasn't really nearly as attractive as the view of it from the beach.  We quickly ran through the lovely duomo.  It had a lovely garden with some Moorish arches and colorful frescoes.  In the basement was a striking bronze status of some saint (that I don't know the name of...) The mail church is amazingly ornate, yet still light and airy.

p. After the duomo we had a so-so lunch in a nearby piazza.  Owen and Ryan kept complaining about the sun, so I ran out and got them some sunglasses.  They loved them (basically, all the hats were too big) and wore them non-stop for the rest of the trip, or until Owen lost his in Sicily at Isola Bella.  This picture is my favorite of the whole trip.

p. After lunch, we took a quick walk through town and then took a bus to the truly vertical town of Positano.  Again we wandered down to the beach and let the kids play for another hour.  Angela and I just stared at the town while the kids played with the boats and throwing rocks.

p. We had intended to eat at this well reviewed restaurant on the beach; however, I walked over to make sure they did an early dinner -- sadly, they didn't.  We basically ran back up the hill to get on a VERY FULL bus home, where I had both boys on my lap and Angela had to stand.

p. What a nice day out, what lovely views and towns.

p. Back in Sorrento, we ate at a nice pizza place called _al Gardnio_.  On the way home, Owen bought Ryan a gift for his birthday -- a red scooter like his green one.
