h1. Thailand

h2. Chaing Mai ~ Day 5

p. _HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY_

p. We got picked up early and drove out to an elephant training camp.  We paid for a 1 hour ride on an elephant, which was wonderful and the scariest thing I have ever done.  Its muddy from rain and they make this elephant climb up and down 45 degree inclines with 3 people. We kept thinking it was going to go over ass over tea kettle...... and crush us comically into the deep mud.

p. They also had a show that showed how elephants were used in the Teak plantations that made Thailand famous (no more forestry, they are ecologically very protective in Thailand).

p. Then a Wat with 2,000 stairs up a mountain.  It was amazing, the Wat was so nice and the views of Chaing Mai below and the mountains was wonderful.

p. We then got dropped off in town and ate lunch at a wonderful place that also sold deep fried insects (we did not partake).

p. That night we went to the town's night market and another nice restaurant on the river and had fish....

p. Then to a pub for the world cup (huge there) and beerssss..... we drank lots of nice Thai beer and more than 8 litters of water a day because it was sooo HOT.
