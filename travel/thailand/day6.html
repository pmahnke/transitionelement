h1. Thailand

h2. Chaing Mai to Mae Hong San ~ Day 6

p. _HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY_

p. Today we flew to Mae Hong San the town closest to the Mynamar border 20 miles.  The town was nothing really, one street and two wats.  We meet some travelers there, our first, no one travels there at the peak of the hot season right before the rainy season.  Of course one couple lives on John's block in NYC, small world.  The other was a wonderful couple from Melbourne, AU.  We ended up travelling with them for three days.

p. We saw the town and then rented scooters and went out of town to a Fish Cave where fish grow fat in this cave that goes for 16 mile with a divable waterfall and beautiful farms.

p. Then we took off through the country side to see farming and went to a waterfall to swim.  Very nice.  Except these three westerners staring at Angela swiming... The only other three westerners we saw. Bastards.
