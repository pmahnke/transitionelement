h1. Thailand

h2. Chaing Mai to Sukothai ~ Day 9

p. _HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY_

p. We took a plane to Sukothai and saw this amazing ancient capital that is really ruins in a lovely park.  Apparently was only discovered from the air, they saw some lines in the jungle that suggested walls.  The whole place is a mass of temples, but was really the heart of a palace and a city.  Really worth the trip.

p. We met a wonderful English couple that we spent a lot of time with just wandering around.  They told us all about the south, and Koh Samui.

p. We spent the night attempting to get a ride to the airport in the morning. ( _Sanam bin kwrap?_ )  We got one and hung out in a really local night market that was a lot of fun to walk around in.  Thailand comes alive at night.  Its really the only cool time of the day.  We bought quite a few good snacks and little presents for home.
