Bangkok to Chaing Mai \~ Day 4
------------------------------

*HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY*

I picked the most wonderful hotel, the River Ping Guesthouse. It was a
very old teak (native wood of Thailand). They only have 6 rooms and it
turned out that we were the only people who stayed there all the days
that we did, which was sad but nice. It also had the highest rated
restaurant in Chaing Mai (tell me I know what battles to fight) and it
still cost NOTHING… you can’t spend money if you try!!!

We went into town, with umbrellas up the keep the HEAT away. We went
into the Walled portion of Chaing Mai and saw a Wat, dying in the heat,
we accepted a air conditioned taxi for the rest or the day from a really
nice Thai man for like 10 dollars. We like the air conditioning so much
we hired him for the next day for seeing some things outside the city.

This is apparently a very ancient way of living in Thailand, and it
makes sense. They go to the bathroom in their back yard gardens, which
are communal. And use the river for everything else. Since it is a
jungle and really HOT…. who would want to work to keep paths and
everything else from overgrowing.

That night we ate at the restaurant at the hotel, the best one in Chaing
Mai it was wonderful and the staff was too. They even brought us
mosquito coils while we were playing cards looking at the river.
