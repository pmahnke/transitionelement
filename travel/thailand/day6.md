Chaing Mai to Mae Hong San \~ Day 6
-----------------------------------

*HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY*

Today we flew to Mae Hong San the town closest to the Mynamar border 20
miles. The town was nothing really, one street and two wats. We meet
some travelers there, our first, no one travels there at the peak of the
hot season right before the rainy season. Of course one couple lives on
John’s block in NYC, small world. The other was a wonderful couple from
Melbourne, AU. We ended up travelling with them for three days.

We saw the town and then rented scooters and went out of town to a Fish
Cave where fish grow fat in this cave that goes for 16 mile with a
divable waterfall and beautiful farms.

This was a scene typical of what we rode through, really lovely
mountains and rice paddies and homes on stilts.

This was a ‘magical cave’ teaming with fish — really interesting.

Then we took off through the country side to see farming and went to a
waterfall to swim. Very nice. Except these three westerners staring at
Angela swimming… The only other three westerners we saw. Bastards.
