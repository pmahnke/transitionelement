h1. Thailand

h2. Mae Hong San to Pai ~ Day 7

p. _HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY_

p. The two couples we met and us hired a mini van for the 8 hour drive to Pai, the most northern city we went to.

p. Pai was nothing, but a place to go trekking to see the hill tribe people.  We couldn't find a trek leaving when we were there, the season was soooo low.... We decided to go back to Chaing Mai for another day, Sukothai (an ancient capital) and spend more time on the beach.
