h1. Thailand

h2. Koh Samui ~ Day 11 to 17

p. _HOT HOT 99F 80% HUMIDITY _a little better_

p. Basically Koh Sumui is a very laid back resort island that is made up of lots of smaller hotels and beach bungelos.  You can easily get to some nice diving and snorkalling.  However, I got Denge Fever from that night in Pai... so I didn't want to dive.  Basically every day was a repeat of the previous.

* Wake up around 9am
* Swim in the ocean
* Eat breakfast
* Buy water
* Go to the beach for the day
* Swim
