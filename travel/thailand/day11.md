Thailand
========

Koh Samui \~ Day 11 to 17
-------------------------

\_HOT HOT 99F 80% HUMIDITY *a little better*

Basically Koh Sumui is a very laid back resort island that is made up of
lots of smaller hotels and beach bungelos. You can easily get to some
nice diving and snorkalling. However, I got Denge Fever from that night
in Pai… so I didn’t want to dive. Basically every day was a repeat of
the previous.

-   Wake up around 9am
-   Swim in the ocean
-   Eat breakfast
-   Buy water
-   Go to the beach for the day
-   Swim

-   Swim

-   Read
-   Swim
-   Walk up the beach to find a wonderful dinner on the beach somewhere
    on the island (usually bbq tiger prawn or fish)
-   Play cards

-   Watch world cup
-   Sleep

After this, we headed to Bangkok for one more night then 32 hours of
flights home — *ouch*!
