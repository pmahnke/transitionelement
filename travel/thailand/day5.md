Thailand
========

Chaing Mai \~ Day 5
-------------------

*HOT HOT HOT 99F 100% HUMIDITY*

We got picked up early and drove out to an elephant training camp. We
paid for a 1 hour ride on an elephant, which was wonderful and the
scariest thing I have ever done. Its muddy from rain and they make this
elephant climb up and down 45 degree inclines with 3 people. We kept
thinking it was going to go over ass over tea kettle…… and crush us
comically into the deep mud.

Here we are heading out for a very uncomfortable 30 minutes

They also had a show that showed how elephants were used in the Teak
plantations that made Thailand famous (no more forestry, they are
ecologically very protective in Thailand).

Then we went to a hydroponic Orchid Farm that was cool it also had
butterflies and moths.

Then a Wat with 2,000 stairs up a mountain. It was amazing, the Wat was
so nice and the views of Chaing Mai below and the mountains was
wonderful.

We then got dropped off in town and ate lunch at a wonderful place that
also sold deep fried insects (we did not partake).

That night we went to the town’s night market and another nice
restaurant on the river and had fish…

Then to a pub for the world cup (huge there) and beerssss… we drank lots
of nice Thai beer and more than 8 litters of water a day because it was
sooo HOT.
