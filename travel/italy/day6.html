h2. Day 6 - Chianti with Day Trip to Sienna

p. _August 23, 2000 - 94F_


p. Today we drove to Sienna and walked around for the better part of the day.

p. Angela tried to climb the clock tower, but after an hour of delayed ticket sales and long lines, she gave up. I decided not to climb with Owen after the painful Bologne experience.

p. While we waited for Angela, Owen and I played in the moving shadow of the clock tower and in the drinking fountains. Everyone loved to watch Owen playing in the fountains. They are only knee high for most people, but a shower for him.

p. After the failed ascent, we went for toasts at a local place and went to the Duomo and Bapistry.

p. The Baptistery was really lovely inside. Blue frescoes and a wonderful fonte. The church was nice, but pretty empty inside. The church tower was magnificent with strips of grey and white.

p. After the Duomo, we headed back to the Villa Rosa for a swim and dinner.

p. Dinner was:

* Bruchetta and Seafood Rice Salad 
* Sage Ravioli 
* Salad and Breaded Veal with Tomatoes 
* Ice Cream
