Northern Italy
==============

Day 4 - Venice to Chianti via Bologne
-------------------------------------

*August 22, 2000 - 93F*

We left Venice early and headed for Bologne to climb one of the famous
towers. Bologne is a really overlooked by tourists. Its a lovely town of
terra cotta roofs and grand covered walkways.

Angela made me climb a huge tower there carrying Owen up all 20 stories
of these really narrow, worn, rickety stairs. However, the view was
amazing.

After Bolgne we drove around Florence to Panzon in Chianti to our hotel
\[Villa Rosa - 055-852-577 - 200.000 Lira per night\]. Its a very nice
300+ year old home with a new pool and out doors eating area.

The owners greeted us and gave us a great big room for Owen.

We immediately went for a swim. Owen loved it! But the horse flies were
deadly, so we left.

We went into a neighboring village for ham, cheese, yogurt and water for
Owen. Owen love the smoked ham.

We ate dinner at the Villa Rosa, it was wonderful. The owner recommended
a great wine for me, Casa Loste, an amazing organic Chiant from the
area. Angela isn’t drinking, as she is pregnant with baby \#2.

Dinner was:

-   Bread Salad
-   Grilled Vegtables & Pecorino
-   Rigatoni with Tomato and Eggplant
-   Salad and Meatloaf
-   Biscotti and an after dinner drink

After dinner, Angela put Owen to be and we talked to a nice English
couple, David and Eileen about culture, politics and schools. Eileen
didn’t like New York mayor Rudy Guillani too much.

NOTE: *Tuscany is a lot hillier than we ever thought and really pretty
with its sun baked colors.*
