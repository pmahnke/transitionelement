Northern Italy
==============

Day 9 - Florence
----------------

*August 26, 2000 - 92F*

Today the Uffizi in the morning and the Accademi in the afternoon with
the Medici Chapel in-between. The Uffizi was nice but small \[Peter’s
expert art commentary\] The Medici was lovely. The Michelango sculptures
were amazing and the doodles were neat too.

The chapel was all inlaid stone, very impressive.

The Accademi was more Michangelo works and of course David.

We tried to buy gifts for everyone, but the shop keeper screwed up the
cost of shipping and it ended up costing more to ship that to buy
anything. Since we are tight on space, no gifts for anyone.

For Dinner we were sent to Piazzi Sant Spiritu, but it was way too
upscale for Owen. So we had a drink and went to a local place where the
owner’s kids wanted to play with Owen. We got Owen a nice winter coat on
the way.

Also, Angela climbed the duomo’s bell tower.
