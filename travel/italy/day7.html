h1(title). Northern Italy

h2. Day 7 - Chianti with a Day Trip to San Gimignano

p. _August 24, 2000 - 94F_


p. Today we drove to San Gimiganano, the "Manhattan of Italy" because of the numerous tall towers in the hill town.

p. It was small and lovely. There was a nice market and lots of good stores.

p. I bought a 300.000 Lira briefcase like I have always wanted.

p. After we drove into the wine regions new Giaole and Radda in Chianti. We went to Meleto with a nice castle, but no one opened the store for the hour we walked around. Owen played with a "car car" at the castle. Since he is rarely in one, I think he was pretty interested in them.

p. After Meleto we went to Volpaia and I bought two bottles in the town tower. The lady showed us a back road to Vignamaggio. It was dirt and rocks for 10 miles or so. But very quick compared to the normal roads.

p. The wine wasn't as good here and the people were certainly less nice, so we quickly moved along.

p. Then to Casa Loste, my favorite wine that I have had the whole trip. However a large truck blocked the path, so we decided to go the next day on the way to Florence.

p. We headed back to the Villa Rosa for a swim and dinner.

p. Dinner was:

* Melon and Prosciutto 
* Spaghetti Pomodoro 
* Pork with Fennel Flower and Salad 
* Ice Cream with Peaches
