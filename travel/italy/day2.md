Day 2 - Milan to Venice via Bergamo and Padova
----------------------------------------------

*August 19, 2000 - 95F*

After breakfast on the terrace we got a taxi to the Hertz rental car
place. After an hour figuring out the car seat, we were off to Bergamo,
1 1/2 hours away.

Bergamo is an old fortified hill town. It was really small, but lovely.
We had pizza in a park and walked through the townâ€™s streets, stores and
churched. We walked through their outdoor theater and saw a really
interesting solar calendar.

After Bergamo, we drove 1 hour to Padova to see the Giotto frescoes in
the Serovegni Chapel, a blast from Art History 101. Needless to say, it
was wonderful.

Leaving Padova, Angela had many issues with the one way road and it took
a kind man on a scooter to lead her out of the city. From there it was a
half hour drive to Venice. We parked and took the \#82 Vaperetto boat to
the Accademia stop and walked to our hotel \[Hotel American - S.Vio 638
- Accademia 30123 - 041-520-4733\].

It was a nice hotel in the old Ventian style. Accademia is across from
the really busy parts of Venice, San Marco and Rialto Bridge, but close
with the Accademia Bridge right there.

After unpacking, we ran over to San Marco to get our bearings. Then we
went to dinner at a little place on the Canal della Guidecca (the land
side of Venice). The food was awful, but Owen loved running up and down
the docks.

After dinner we had gelato and sat on the tiny balcony of the room as
Owen slept. Very nice.
