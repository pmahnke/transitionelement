h2. Day 4 - Venice to Chianti via Bologne

p. _August 22, 2000 - 93F_

p. We left Venice early and headed for Bologne to climb one of the famous towers. Bologne is a really overlooked by tourists. Its a lovely town of terra cotta roofs and grand covered walkways.

p. Angela made me climb a huge tower there carrying Owen up all 20 stories of these really narrow, worn, rickety stairs. However, the view was amazing.

p. After Bolgne we drove around Florence to Panzon in Chianti to our hotel [Villa Rosa - 055-852-577 - 200.000 Lira per night]. Its a very nice 300+ year old home with a new pool and out doors eating area.

p. The owners greeted us and gave us a great big room for Owen.

p. We immediately went for a swim. Owen loved it! But the horse flies were deadly, so we left.

p. We went into a neighboring village for ham, cheese, yogurt and water for Owen. Owen love the smoked ham.

p. We ate dinner at the Villa Rosa, it was wonderful. The owner recommended a great wine for me, Casa Loste, an amazing organic Chiant from the area. Angela isn't drinking, as she is pregnant with baby #2.

p. Dinner was:

* Bread Salad 
* Grilled Vegtables & Pecorino 
* Rigatoni with Tomato and Eggplant 
* Salad and Meatloaf 
* Biscotti and an after dinner drink 

p. After dinner, Angela put Owen to be and we talked to a nice English couple, David and Eileen about culture, politics and schools. Eileen didn't like New York mayor Rudy Guillani too much.

p. NOTE: _Tuscany is a lot hillier than we ever thought and really pretty with its sun baked colors._
