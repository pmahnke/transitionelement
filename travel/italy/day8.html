p. We drove to Florence and parked at the old city wall and walked 15 minutes to the Hotel Relais Uffize [055-265-790 - 222.000 Lira per night]. The hotel is right off Piazza della Signoria, the main square in Florence. The hotel is owned by the same people that own the Villa Rosa and has a great view of the square.
We settled down Owen, then head out to walk around town. We go right to the duomo and check it out. Its lovely with white, pink and green stripes.

p. The Piazza della Signoria was where the David was for centuries. It right next to the Uffizi Museum. We had the receptionist get us ticket for the Accadamia and the Uffize tomorrow. Also dinner reservation at the 4 Lionese.

p. We also saw the Pitti Palace, Medici Tombs and Medici Library.

p. Dinner was ok, not great.
