h2. Day 3 - Venice

p. _August 20, 2000 - 97F_

p. Today we started at San Marco Square. We hauled Owen to the roof of the Cathedral for a nice view of the square and the gold mosaic ceilings in the church.

p. We walked around the Bell Tower and the Doge's Palace as well.

p. Then we wandered over to the Rialto Bridge. We walked over to the San Polo side and rambled back toward our hotel on Dorsoduro Island. On the way we stopped for lunch in St Tomasso Square.

p. We had toasts. Owen devoured a hot dog toast and generally shook all the plant holders and chairs in the place. He loved running around the square and looking at the water in the canals.

p. After lunch we went to our hotel to let Owen take a nap. We quickly realized that Owen was too excited the whole trip to take a normal nap, he would only sleep in the stroller or car.

p. Realizing this, we headed out for the end of Dorsedoro to to the La Salute Church, built to thank God for delivering Venice from the Plague.

p. We sat and played for a while at the end, then slowly wandered back to the hotel. We walked by the Peggy Guggenheim museum on a lovely little side canal.
