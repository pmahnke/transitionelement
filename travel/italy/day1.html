p. Good flight except Owen screamed for about 1 1/2 hours right after the movie and when everyone was trying to sleep.

p. We took the express train to the Milan City Center and a taxi to our hotel [Antica Locanda dei Merchanti - Via San Tomaso 6 - 02-805-4080].  We checked into a lovely room with a huge terrace.

p. After a two hour nap we walked on the pedestrian street to the Duomo, the highlight of Milan.

p. We climbed to the roof and enjoyed the wonderful views of the platzo.

p. After we grabbed some lunch and then went looking for a stroller for Owen.  It was far to warm to wear the backpack that we had brought with us.  We found what has turned out to be my favorite, a Monbebe at Prenatal for 100,000 Lira or $46 USD.

p. We tried to go to see the "Last Supper" but couldn't get in.  We attempted to call for reservations the following morning, but failed to get phone to do anything but rudely beep and ask for more and more money.

p. For dinner we went out unfashionably early, as we did for the whole trip because of Owen.  We ate at a nice place the hotel recommended.  The best part was the waitresses from the restaurant next store liked Owen so much, that they basically baby sat him for the meal.  Then our waiter's son and wife came by and took over for the waitresses.
