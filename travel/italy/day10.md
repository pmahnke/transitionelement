Northern Italy
==============

Day 10 - Florence to Parma
--------------------------

*August 27, 2000 - 92F*

Today we took it more leisurely and got a cab to where our car was
parked. The man there said we owed 140.000 Lira, but we only had 100.000
Lira. He insisted that we pay the hourly rate, we argued and waited for
the manager who agreed with us and charged us only 36.000 Lira like we
thought.

We then drove via the coast to Parma. Based on time, interest and Owen’s
patience we decided to skip Pisa.

Parma we found really nice and tourist free. We got there at 1:30 pm and
ran to lunch at our hotel’s \[Palace Hotel - Maria Liguria\] fancy
restaurant, Maxim. Lunch was great.

Then we walked the town, which was simple and lovely; however, nothing
was open as it was Sunday and in the middle of the August break.

We ended up at the Ducal Garden, a big park and let Owen run around
collecting ®’ocks and pushing the stroller. We left as we noticed a
large storm moving in and got to the hotel in time for five hours of
much needed rain.

After a nap we went back to Maxims for a lovely dinner.

Tomorrow we wake early and drive to Milan to fly home.
