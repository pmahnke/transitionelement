Northern Italy
==============

Day 4 - Venice
--------------

*August 21, 2000 - 97F*

We started the day wandering over to the American Express office in San
Marco to inquire about the tours that they run. Ultimately Owen took his
first real nap of the trip right through the gondola tour that we wanted
to take.  
After the American Express office we went to the Jewish Ghetto Museum
and took a tour of 3 of the 5 synagogues there. Its a pretty poor tour
and Owen was in no mood to be infoors, so we took turns staying outside
with him playing in the public water fountain.

Throughout the trip, Owen would take half hour breaks and play in these
fountains that you find in nearly every square in the city. Its very
cute to watch.

In the afternoon we wandered back over the Accademia Bridge and walked
deeply into San Marco Island looking for a church that was closed, but
is know for good St. George and the Dragon paintings \[San Giogio degli
Scliavioa\]. Then we went for drinks in a square near the Rialto area
and Owen climbed up and down some stairs for nearly an hour.

Dinner was across the Rialto Bridge at Trattoria della Madonna, an old
school restaurant that was good, but a little boring.

Then we walked back to Dorsodoro and to the water front for a gelati and
drink.
