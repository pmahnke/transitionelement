h2. Day 4 - Venice

p. _August 21, 2000 - 97F_


p. We started the day wandering over to the American Express office in San Marco to inquire about the tours that they run. Ultimately Owen took his first real nap of the trip right through the gondola tour that we wanted to take.
After the American Express office we went to the Jewish Ghetto Museum and took a tour of 3 of the 5 synagogues there. Its a pretty poor tour and Owen was in no mood to be infoors, so we took turns staying outside with him playing in the public water fountain.

p.  Throughout the trip, Owen would take half hour breaks and play in these fountains that you find in nearly every square in the city. Its very cute to watch.

p. In the afternoon we wandered back over the Accademia Bridge and walked deeply into San Marco Island looking for a church that was closed, but is know for good St. George and the Dragon paintings [San Giogio degli Scliavioa]. Then we went for drinks in a square near the Rialto area and Owen climbed up and down some stairs for nearly an hour.

p. Dinner was across the Rialto Bridge at Trattoria della Madonna, an old school restaurant that was good, but a little boring.

p. Then we walked back to Dorsodoro and to the water front for a gelati and drink.
