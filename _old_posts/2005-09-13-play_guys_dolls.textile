I love the movie and the music, plus this production was starring Ewan McGregor, so we decided to get tickets.  Basically, it was excellent.  I loved the sets, the acting, the music, the sound and the singing.  They really did a great job.  My _only_ complaint was that the accents seemed a little fake (which they were).  

Oh, and the theatre really needs to open more doors at intermission, getting to the pub next door where our pints were waiting took nearly 15 minutes!
