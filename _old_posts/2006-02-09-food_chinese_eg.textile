Based on the classic Chinese dish, "Ants Climbing a Tree", named because of the way the pork looks in the sauce, this has eggplant as a base.  It is as good with tofu.  However, if you love eggplant, you will love this. 

We normally make a simple long bean dish with this that uses very similar ingredients.  Give it a try.
