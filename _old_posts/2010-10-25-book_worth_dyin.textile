h4. Worth Dying For

<em>by (Jack Reacher 15)</em>

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">Synopsis: <em>Initially, we are not told how Jack Reacher survived the seemingly-terminal events of the last book, as he makes his way south to an unwelcoming part of Nebraska in the dead of winter. He fetches up in a town in the grip of the powerful, manipulative Duncan family, and the cowed townspeople have no fight left in them. In a sleazy hotel, he encounters the town's alcoholic doctor, and the two end up driving to a house where they come across a grim case of domestic violence. And Child admirers won't be surprised to learn that Jack's life is soon on the line -- as usual. The stage is set for violent confrontation.</div>

A better Reacher novel than some, a bit formulaic, but very well written again.  It is what you expect and want.  

Great escape.
