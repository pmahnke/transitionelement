*The Last Days of Haute Cuisine*
_by Patric Kuh_

p. I think Hilary gave this to me. Its pretty interesting, but awkwardly written. The thesis is that snobby, pretentious French cuisine that came to the US in the 30's was taken over by real American / Californian food in the 60's and 70's who where actually inspired by the same people as the original French, they just understood food to be different things -- presentation vs. content.
