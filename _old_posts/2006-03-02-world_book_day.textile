Today is world book day and the boys have been planning all week who to go to school as.  Sadly, we only have about four choices of costume, so it isn't that hard to pick.

My eldest is an 'Erosaurus' from Hilary's non-fiction, dinosaur pop-up book.  My youngest is the goldfish from _Cati in the Hat_.  Even the boy's teachers were dressed up.  One teacher was 'Little Red Ridding Hood' and the other was 'Bob the Builder' -- I have to do school pick-up today!

Very cute.
