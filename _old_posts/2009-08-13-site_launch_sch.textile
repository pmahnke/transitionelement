This summer the web team has been very busy.  We have had to work on three web sites simultaneously while doing more minor updates on a host of others.  The biggest project has been creating a "site for parents to order online for our Book Clubs division":http://clubs-shop.scholastic.co.uk/.

We only had 11 weeks and had to update the "Children's Book Club site":http://clubs-kids.scholastic.co.uk/ and substantially rework the "Teacher's Book Club site":http://clubs-teachers.scholastic.co.uk/schoolbookclub/ as well as create a whole new shop.

We feel the end result is excellent and early sales are promising.
