p. I am on an 'Alternatives to Microsoft' email list at my "company":http://europe.gartner.com and this game has probably wasted over $10,000 of company time.

p. Not only have loads of top analysts vied for top points, but we even have someone ROT-13[1] little jokes to people.

p. All fun, here is my best...

fn1.. "rot13":http://www.rot13.com/info.php

bc.. /rot ther'teen/ 
[Usenet: from "rotate alphabet 13 places"],  v. 
The simple Caesar-cypher encryption that replaces each  English letter with the
one 13 places forward or back along  the alphabet, so that "The butler did it!"
becomes "Gur ohgyre  qvq vg!" Most Usenet news reading and posting programs 
include a rot13 feature. It is used to enclose the text in a  sealed wrapper that
the reader must choose to open - e.g. for  posting things that might offend some
readers, or spoilers.  A major advantage of rot13 over rot(N) for other N is that it 
is self-inverse, so the same code can be used for encoding and  decoding.
