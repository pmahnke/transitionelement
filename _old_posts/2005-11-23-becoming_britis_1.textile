After our fourth year in the United Kingdom, we were given our _indefinite leave to remain_ at the low low price of {-L}500, having just missed the cut-off where it was free.  This year we will get to become _British Citizens_ (actually dual citizens, we are keeping the USA as well) but we are again narrowly missing the deadline to avoid taking a 45 minute test on "Life in the UK" and the "Citizenship Ceremony".

So to prepare, I went to the "British Citizenship website":http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/british_citizenship/english/homepage.html to learn about the process.  I was greeted by the above image of Stonehenge and people dancing -- apparently you must become a Druid and learn to dance around on various solecists.

I turns out the actual test is so obscure that the media here is joking about it.  If you fancy yourself an Anglophile, the BBC put up a "sample test here":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4099770.stm.  Just like having to retake the drivers test, I will have to study some strange book for a month just to pass.

Wonderful.
