<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>Harry Bosch is back in Homicide after disciplinary leave. But his first case proves to be one of the most difficult... In the wooded hills overlooking the Hollywood Bowl, he opens the trunk of a white Rolls Royce and finds a corpse. It looks like a simple case of Trunk Music - a Mafia hit, the victim shot in his own vehicle - but the victim is movie producer Tony Aliso - and the Mafia weren't the only ones after him. Bosch finds himself up against the FBI - and back in the arms of a beautiful ex-felon. It's starting to look like Harry's first case back in Homicide is in danger of being his last...</em></div>
