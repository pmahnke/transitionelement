*Bon Appetit!: Travels Through France with Knife, Fork and Corkscrew*
  
_by Peter Mayle_


Much like my feelings about "A Year in Provence":/archives/2005/10/books_a_year_in.html this was a good light read.  Written in same style, that of memoires, Peter Mayle travels France visiting seeming strange country fairs celebrating special food festivals and celebrations.  Its part descriptive and part journal, so it never attempts to authoritative, just light hearted.  Again, the book is peppered with enough French phrases to throw off anyone without some good understanding of the language (albeit briefly).  The cast of characters (his friends and people he meets) are as interesting.

If you like this style of writing, give it a go.
