p. We have been luck enough to travel around a fair amount.  I have been very slow to add these trips to the weblog; however, its a fair amount of work.

p. I share the pictures and the comments because sites like these have been invaluable in helping us plan trips.  I just want to give back a little.

p. I will slowly be adding many of the ones that were on the old site and adding a few of our newer trips.  If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email peter@transitionelement.com or write a comment.
