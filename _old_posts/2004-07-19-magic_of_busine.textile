I love lifestyle and business photography.  Most of us don't even realize what we are looking on business websites and many magazines.  Its just normal to be reading a story on the growth of PDAs or something with an image of an attractive kid on a scooter with a phone.  Part of the problem is that it is hard to take an abstract concept and depict it graphically... or even photographically.   But occasionally you come across a real winner, one that makes you think... "it is me, or was the creative guy here on drugs..."

This image...


<a href="/assets/images/getty_women_on_phone_image.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/getty_women_on_phone_image-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="274" alt="ray lifestyle image" border="0" /></a>

was selected by the lead designer on one of the websites I work with professionally.

and he turned it into...

<a href="/assets/images/20040714_fp_homepage.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/20040714_fp_homepage-thumb.jpg" width="100" height="68" border="0" alt="resulting lifestyle image"  class="img_plain"/></a>

this... for an article on _outsourcing_.

I _love_ it... nothing says "outsourcing" to me than two attractive women in the high desert  in business attire on a phone... it just sings to me.

Actually I recommended this image, but it was rejected...

<a href="/assets/images/sweatshop_mumbai.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/sweatshop_mumbai-thumb.jpeg" width="100" height="65" alt="sweat shop image" border="0" /></a>

Now, I think that *screams* outsourcing!
