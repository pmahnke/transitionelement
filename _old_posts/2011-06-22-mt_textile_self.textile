Today I did some general CPAN update.  Everything went fine, I thought, but when I attempted to publish a post to this blog with Movable Type 3.38, I kept getting this error:

==
<pre><code>
An error occurred:
Global symbol "$nested" requires explicit package name at (re_eval 34) line 2, <DATA> line 1.
Compilation failed in regexp at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/SelfLoader.pm line 112, <DATA> line 1.
</code></pre>
==

After a minor amount of digging, I found it was either SelfLoader.pm or Textile2.

==
<pre><code>
perl -MSelfLoader -e 'print 1'
</code></pre>
==

returned '1'

I attempted to upgrade to the MT 4.X versions of textile2, but MT 3 didn't recognise it at all.

So, I just added ... 

==
<pre><code>
my $nested = "";
</code></pre>
==

... to SelfLoader.pm and it works.

Who knows if that will cause other errors later, but it all works now.

Hope this might help someone else.
