I have loved the music of the _Kings of Leon_ from before the release of _Youth & Young Manhood_.  At once they sound familiar, like some thing from the 70's, but more energy.  I had wanted to see them on their previous tour, but couldn't arrange the sitter, etc.

We finally got to see them after the release of their second album, the equally excellent, _Aha Shake Heartbreak_ and it was a good thing too.  They have so little material that for the encores, they had to replay some songs they played previously.

However, they are very good live with a ton of energy.  Good musicians as well.  They only note would be they have to banter between songs _at all_.  No stories or anything...

I can't wait for their third album.
