h4. Fever Crumb (Mortal Engines Quartet Prequel)

<em>Philip Reeve</em>

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">Synopsis: <em>Fever Crumb is set many generations before the events of Mortal Engines, in whose dazzling world huge, predatory cities chase and devour each other. Armoured fortresses are advancing towards London. Buried deep in the city’s past is a terrible secret that may save it from destruction. Only one key can unlock it – an odd-looking orphan named Fever Crumb</em></div>

Excellent prequel that sets up the Mortal Engines quartet.  You start to learn about the moving cities and the birth of Shrike.  Really well done.
