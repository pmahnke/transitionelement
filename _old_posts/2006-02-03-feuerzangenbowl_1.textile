This weekend we were treated to a seasonal favourite from our good friends Dirk and Gulin.

# Warm four bottles of red wine with four sliced un-waxed oranges
# Add some spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc...
# Pour into a glass bowl on a stand
# Light a parafine stove beneth to keep warm.
# Suspend a cone of refined sugar suspened over the bowl
# Soak the cone in 151 proof Rum
# Ignite cone
# Back away from the bowl
# Watch carmelized liquid sugar drip into the wine
# Drink the wine
# Repeat if still sober
