Today was a shock for me.

I was IMing with someone at my work, who is based in Stamford, CT.  At the end of the conversation, she said, "talk to you Tuesday."  I figured she must be taking a long weekend or something and didn't think much of it.

A little later, some one else said, "I will have to take a look at that on Tuesday."  This time, I thought it was strange, but the person got off the phone before I could ask.

A little later still, I was on the phone with a German colleague who said that we would have to wait until Tuesday for the US to respond.  I finally asked, "Tracy, what is going on Monday that no one is working in the US?  So far three people have mentioned it...".

Tracy just laughed, "Isn't it _your_ Independence Day_?"

*SNAP*

_silence_

"Ah, yes, thanks..."

I have been over in London for four years and forgot, completely.  Its such a non-event here that it didn't register.  Also, no one I talk to regularly has mentioned any big plans... but how lame am I?
