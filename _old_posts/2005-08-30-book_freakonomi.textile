*Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*

_by Steven Levitt & Stephen  Dubner_

Well, I am probably the second last person ever to read this book.  It was a quick read and very interesting; however, I wish it wasn't quite so dumbed down.  It was so commercial that I missed the real hard work and out-of-the-box thinking that was required to put each vignette together.  It also stops short of bringing any morality into the topics at all, purposely -- but I think its hard to discuss how legalized abortion led to a massive decline in crime 15-20 years later and not think of ethics!

Ah well, a good read and fun to discuss.
