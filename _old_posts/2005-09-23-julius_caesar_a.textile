We went to see Julius Caesar at the Lyric Hammersmith with some friends.  It was great. I don’t think I have ever seen it performed, but read the play a few times. This was a Royal Shakespeare Company staging — very modern, and well acted. Marc Anthony, Brutus and Cassius were specially well done.

Afterwards we even had time for two leisurely pints at the St Margarets Travern
