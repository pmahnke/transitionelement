#### Uniform Justice

_By by Donna Leon_

Rating: ★★★★

A good friend loaned me this book. Something I would never have picked up on my own. However, I read it and really liked it. Its sort of a cross between a crime/detective story and a travelogue. You get a decent crime to be solved, but in Venice and learn about the life of a family there.

While the characters are well done, the morality play is a little hard to ponder in this one, where coruption wins the day. Perhaps this is reality, but it sort of feels pathetic at the same time. I am now well on my way to reading the rest of the series.
