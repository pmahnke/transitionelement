#### Doctored Evidence

_By by Donna Leon_

Rating: ★★★★

Again, an excellent Guido Brunetti mystery. This one is about a old widow found murdered. Nearly everyone who knew the lady wished her dead. Too many false trails nearly distract Guido from solving the case, but he gets there in the end. About three quarters of the way through I figured out where the solution lay, buy didn't know until the final twenty pages. Very exciting.
