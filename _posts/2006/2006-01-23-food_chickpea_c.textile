Years ago, when I was consulting at Citibank, I was taken to this great little italian restaurant on 53<sup>rd</sup> (between 2<sup>nd</sup> & 3<sup>rd</sup>) called _Luna Piena_.  One day as a special they had a 'Carrot & Chickpea Soup' and I immediately feel in love and copied it as best I could.

The recipe is the essense of simplicity and really allows you to taste the all the flavors and the textures.  You can also scale it up to serve lots of people if you need to.

Great with crusty bread, soft cheeses, sausage and light red or full white wine.
