h4. Made in Italy

_by Giorgio Locatelli _

I think Giorgio is a superb chef with a real understanding of what is important about ingredients (key), creativity (less important than good) and eating (social).

We were lucky enough to hear him speak at the Richmond (London, UK) Book Festival and meet him. He was raised in a family that ran a hotel (1 star Michelin) with a restaurant and where family was important and simple and local was best. He is funny, absurd and irreverent.

The book has some of these stories, but the passion for the recipes is what really matters. If you are a foodieâ€¦ this is a great book.
