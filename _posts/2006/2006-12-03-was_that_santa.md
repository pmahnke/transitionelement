"Dad, was that *really* Santa?"

"Humm, what did you think Owen?"

"Well, he didn't say 'HO HO HO'"

"Is that what Santa does?"

"Yes and is fat with a white beard and he wants to make toys all the time..."

"So Santa has sudden urges to make toys?"

"Yes"

"Maybe that was just one of Santa's helpers then"

"I think so"
