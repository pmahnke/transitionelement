Having been to China twice and generally in love with their art and culture, I had to see this show at the Royal Academy of Arts. [China: The Three Emperors (1662-1795)](http://www.threeemperors.org.uk/) absolutely lived up to my expectations. The size, range and quality of the works was impressive. <a href="/assets/images/threeemperors.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/threeemperors-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="249" alt="emperor" class="photo right" /></a> Real care was taken to preserve all the clothing, furniture and scrolls -- everything was in perfect condition.

Learning from previous experience, we got the boys 'kids' audio guides which gave us a full two hours to peruse. The scrolls and paintings were the most exciting for me. The gallery had unrolled some 60-70 feet of many of them. The detail was fantastic.

If you have a chance to see this, make the effort. Its worth it.
