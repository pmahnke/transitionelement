Well, I seriously doubt if it will help, but I thought I should cover all bases and post my CV/Resume here.

I have been made redundant/laid off as part of a large, long and painful downsizing at my former company and am looking for something in reasonable commuting distance from Twickenham/Richmond in London or some place on the US West Coast (other offers considered).

Ideally I would be running all or parts of a website for a dynamic, information-rich company. However, I am interested in all interesting product/programme management work as well. I would prefer permanent roles, but would consider interesting temp/contract work.

If you are looking for a hard working, strategic, technical, web-savvy manager with loads of experience, please get in touch.
