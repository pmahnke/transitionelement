I was introduced to this dish in university by the woman who (eventually) became my wife. She had spent a number of summers in Spain and learned the dish from the families she lived. I think most people will look at it and think it will be bland -- but it isn't, its luxurious. I think best cold on a crusty roll with absolutely nothing else.

You really need to try it and learn to savour its simplicity. I really think its one of those simple perfect foods. We usually make about three at a time and eat them on picnics or take them for a trip. They are great for a snack, or a filling meal.
