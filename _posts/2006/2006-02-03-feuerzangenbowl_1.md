This weekend we were treated to a seasonal favourite from our good friends Dirk and Gulin.

1.  Warm four bottles of red wine with four sliced un-waxed oranges
2.  Add some spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc...
3.  Pour into a glass bowl on a stand
4.  Light a paraffin stove beneath to keep warm.
5.  Suspend a cone of refined sugar suspended over the bowl
6.  Soak the cone in 151 proof Rum
7.  Ignite cone
8.  Back away from the bowl
9.  Watch carmelized liquid sugar drip into the wine
10. Drink the wine
11. Repeat if still sober
