Usually I like my comedy dark & twisted, but adult & irreverent works too. Avenue Q has it nailed. Wrapped up as a sort of Sesame Street for adults -- a musical with puppets -- it is actually a far more interesting guide to starting out in life having coming from a largely useless liberal arts university (something I know a lot about).

The songs are hilarious, the puppets add a visual humour that actors probably couldn't get away with. My favourite songs had to be _Schadenfreude_, sung by Gary Coleman (<em>really!</em>) about why being a bum or a washed up child actor was good for humanity, _We Are All a Little Bit Racist_ and of course, _The Internet was Made for Porn_.

If you can see this, I really recommend that you do.
