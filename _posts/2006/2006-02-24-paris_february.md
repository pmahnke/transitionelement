This weekend we took advantage of my mother being here to look after the boys and took the Eurostar over to Pars to meet up with old friends.

### Friday

- We took an early Eurostar and arrived in Paris around 1pm.
- We met up with our friends at our hotel at 2pm and took the Metro to the Champs-{E'}lys{e'}es (FDR stop) and walked up to the Arc De Triomphe and went to the top for some great views.
- Then we took another metro to the Eiffel Tower and watched Paris in daylight through sunset and night.
- Afterwards we learned about 'The Book', our friends's infallible guide Lonely Planet Guide as we were guided us to a restaurant Victor Hugo Etoile -- which wasn't open yet and pretty expensive. So we just walked around the circle and found another bistro and had a long, lovely meal.
- After dinner we went back towards our hotels.

### Saturday

- In the morning we met our friends for breakfast and then headed to Montmarte to first see Sacr{e'} Coeur and then the art market behind it, then the windmills ( _where 'The Book' was both amazing, and weak at finding one of the two 'moulin'_ ).
- Then we had a drink across from the Moulin Rouge.
- Afterwards we headed over to the The Catacombs (stop Denfert-Rochereau) and walked the mile underground and saw the millions of skeletons moved there over 150 years ago in an effort to clean-up the Paris cemeteries. It was pretty grim and hard to believe how many generations of people that represented.
- After the underground, we walked around Les Halles area and had a drink in a caf{e'}.
- Then we went to the Palais Royale, near our hotel and found a great place to eat, about half an hour before they were ready... so we had a drink there and talked.
- Then home to bed.

### Sunday

- We met our friends for breakfast, and they headed to the airport.
- We then walked over to Les Halles and bought some food to take home.
- Then we wandered over to Ile de Paris and Notre Dame and bought some presents for the boys.
- It was drizzling the whole time, so we checked out of the hotel and went over to the Louve for a couple of hours.
- Then we had a great lunch in a Caf{e'} we knew from our last trip.
- Finally we headed to Gare du Nord and home by 8pm.

Great trip.

Oh, [here are a load of photos I uploaded testing out Apple's iWeb](http://web.mac.com/pmahnke/iWeb/EE6CB888-67FD-4115-BDC2-20723DD47B36/2006%2002%2019%20-%20Paris.html).
