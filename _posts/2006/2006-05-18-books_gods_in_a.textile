h4. Gods in Alabama

_By by Joshilyn Jackson_

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&frac12;

As you can tell by the rating, I really liked this book.  Its the story of a young woman forced to face her past and go back on her three promises to God.  The characters are really well written and the mystery is carefully revealed in a quick paced narrative with detailed flashbacks.  It is not until the very end that you understand the whole picture and only then can you think back to several hints that were there along the way, but you might have missed.

Joshilyn Jackson's characters are well written and the sub-plots all work and distract only as required.  I am hugely impressed with this as her first major work.
