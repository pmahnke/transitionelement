Today is Mother's Day in the UK.

We men did the natural thing, made Angela pick the meal, buy it (including flowers) and make the desert.

The desert she picked is one of three she makes all the time, and I think her second favorite.  Its profiteroles stuffed with chocolate pudding, mixed with whipped cream.

It can't be simpler either.  

# You make a 'choux' (warm water, butter, sugar and flour with egg mixed in after it cools) and bake little rolls.  
# Make the pudding with some whipped cream to lighten it.
# Cut the pastries in half and fill with pudding right before serving.

Its very nice and feels fancy.   I recommend it highly for a dinner party.
