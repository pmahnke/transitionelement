#### Dublin

_By Edward Rutherfurd_

Rating: ★★★★

I have read Rutherfurd's _Russka_, _Sarum_ and _New Forrest_ and liked or loved them all. I think this was better than the _New Forrest_ but fell down at the end. The characters and storyline from the start up through Brian Boru were amazing, but the English period really slowed down and the links to the previous generations much more tenuous. I also didn't like the unrequited love story of the monk and his love. I don't think real people would have done this, nor did Rutherfurd subject his monk in the _New Forrest_ to such chastity.

That said, I did like it and would recommend it. Its a very human way to learn about history, specially the role of religion and migration and law in this book.
