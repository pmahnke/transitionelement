Last night the wife and I attended a talk with "Giorgio Locatelli":https://stmargarets.london/event/Reading/200610191516 at the Petersham Hotel in Richmond as part of the "Richmond Book Now 2006 Festival":https://stmargarets.london/directory/art/200610191449.

The event was lovely.  Served champagne and canap√©s before the talk.  Giorgio was also mingling with people, which was unexpected.  The talk was very intimate, about 50 people only.  Giorgio talked about his book, his views on artists vs. artisans, sourcing, his life and more.  It was very informal with the audience asking loads of questions and guiding the talk.

At the end, Giorgio signed copies of the book and chatted some more.  We got a copy and I have to say, its huge and looks wonderful.
