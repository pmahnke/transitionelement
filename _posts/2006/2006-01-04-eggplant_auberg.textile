I don't know if I will have the energy to keep this up, but I thought that I might put up a few recipes on the site as I settle on a good one.  This all started a few years ago when my brother (in New York), mother (in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and I (London) all started trading new recipes.  I wrote a little web application to track them.  Unfortunately, due to a major server problem (kernel panic) we lost all of them, and the mounted back-up disk (long sad story).  However, in recent years we have slow started again.

So here is my first entry:

h3. Eggplant (Aubergine) Parmesan

This classic has become complete comfort food for my wife and me.  We make it a few different ways (which are in the recipe) depending on what we are doing with it.  If it is a meal, we usually grill the eggplant.  If its for a smaller portion, we might bread and fry the rounds first.  The problem with this method is a) the fat and b) Angela eats every other round before I can assemble the dish.

I think this makes a great main with a rich salad like a Caesar or one with fruit, nuts and/or cheese.  It can also be a side with some grilled fish or appetiser.  Very versatile.
