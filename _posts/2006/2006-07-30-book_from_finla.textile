h4. Suomesta, rakkaudella/From Finland with love

_by Schatz, Roman; Autio, Maarika_

This book was loaned to me by our Finnish friends, the Einis.  I think Pirjo was trying to explain why she didn't want to move back.  And I have to admit, if the comic cartoon characterisations where true, I wouldn't either.

If you want to understand the cynical and silly version of how the Finn's view themselves, try and find this book.
