h4. Death at La Fenice

_By by Donna Leon_

This is my second Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery.  I liked it better than the first one I read, "Uniform Justice":/assets/images/archives/2006/06/books_uniform_j.html as it didn't really have the same strange passive acceptance of corruption at the end.  Perhaps Italians laugh that non-Italians like these books because they are romantic in their own way, but I admit, I loved Venice and the setting of these stories does add to how much I like them.

Brunetti is an interesting complex and human character.  The whole setting is believable.  A famous conductor doesn't appear for the third act of an opera and is found poisoned in his dressing room.  Who did it, an old flame, a young wife, a singer in the troupe or the producer?  Interesting to the end, even if you know who, you don't really know why.

If you like mysteries, I recommend reading these.
