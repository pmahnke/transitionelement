h4. Shit My Dad Says

<em>by Justin Halpern</em>

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;

<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>Meet Justin Halpern and his dad. Almost one million people follow Mr Halpern's philosophical musings every day on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his sayings. What emerges is a chaotic, hilarious, true portrait of a father and son relationship from a major new comic voice.</em></div>

Pretty funny book, at times I was laughing out loud, but I didn't love it... I think it worked better on twitter.
