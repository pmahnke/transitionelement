Loved this book. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be in print any longer. Angela got it via a complicated library requested that started with a book I read, Stet. We both loved it. It predates the uber-rich players of today, but still, a kid from the bottom rung of life makes it all the way and then falls back down again. Amazingly well told.

Michael Irwin deserved far more recognition for this book that he got. Read it if you can find it!
