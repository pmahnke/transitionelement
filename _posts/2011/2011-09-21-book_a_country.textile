h4. A Country Doctor's Notebook (Vintage Classics)

<em>by Mikhail Bulgakov</em>
>
Rating: ★★★★☆

<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>These straighforward yet extraordinary sketches gain their strength from also being the account of a young man's growth. One begins to see that he became a novelist not because he had material but because he was storing up passion and temperament."</em></div>

I loved these stories.  Well written glimpses into a another world... rural Russia at the start of the communist era.  Definitely worth a read.
