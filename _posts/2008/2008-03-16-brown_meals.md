My wife used to be a "non-adventurous home eater". The one thing we could always agree on was golden brown, or just brown meals were usually delicious. Over the years we have massively expanded that to other colours and flavours, but occasionally, often mistakenly, we have one of our old brown meals. And when we do, we almost always recognise it as the immediate comfort food that it is and make a joke.

The one pictured is Bubble 'n' Squeak and pork Schnitzel.
