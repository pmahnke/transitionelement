#### One Shot

_by Lee Child_

Rating: ★★★½

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>With six shots, five people were dead and one heartland city is thrown into terror. But within hours, the cops have it solved. It is a slam-dunk case, except for one thing -- the accused man claims: "You got the wrong guy". After that, all he'll say is: "Get Reacher for me." Jack Reacher lives off the grid. He is a lone righter of wrongs and is irresistible to women. What could connect the ex-military cop to this obvious psychopath?</em>

Really good, hard to predict.
