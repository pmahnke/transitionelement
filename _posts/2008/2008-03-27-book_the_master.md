#### The Master and Margarita

_by Mikhail Bulgakov_

Rating: ★★★★★

Without question, this is one of the best novels of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The devil and his crew come to Moscow for their annual ball and play with the citizens of the town -- all deserving of their rewards -- rewarding some, punishing others.

Its funny, timeless, political, questions the nature of good and evil all at once. If you can, read this book!
