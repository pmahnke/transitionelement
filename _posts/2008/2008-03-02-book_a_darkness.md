#### A Darkness More Than Night (Harry Bosch)

<em>by Michael Connelly</em>

Rating: ★★★★½

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>Terry McCaleb's enforced quiet lifestyle on the island of Catalina is a far cry from the hectic excitement of his former role as homicide detective in L.A. However, when a small-time criminal is found dead McCaleb is persuaded to profile the killer. Six years ago the victim had been arrested by Harry Bosch for murder but was later released uncharged. In doing what he does best, reviewing the crime scene tapes and investigative records, McCaleb picks up a clue the sheriffs missed, and discovers that the killer left a message at the crime scene - a message that seems to implicate Detective Harry Bosch... Meanwhile Bosch is in the midst of a high stakes trial being covered in the press by Jack McEvoy. Bosch was lead investigator on a murder case that saw the arrest of the son of a wealthy and powerful man. As the trial progresses the defence strategy becomes clear: put Bosch on trial instead of the rich kid, make the focus on Bosch and his methods. McCaleb and Bosch, first at odds, must now work together to clear Harry's name.</em>

AMAZING, Bosch and McEvoy together.
