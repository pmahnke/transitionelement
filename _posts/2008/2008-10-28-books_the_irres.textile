h4. The Irresistible Inheritance of Wilberforce: A Novel in Four Vintages

_by Paul Torday_

The book was well written, the characters were really strong, I tried to enjoy it; however, I don’t think it was 100% able. The problem was I hated Wilberforce. He was so empty, so horrible. He never took, or had to take responsibility for himself -- and I don’t like that in people real or imaginary.
