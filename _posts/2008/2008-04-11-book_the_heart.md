#### The Heart of a Dog

<em>by Mikhail Bulgakov, Michael Glenny</em>

Rating: ★★★★½

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>A rich, successful Moscow professor befriends a stray dog and attempts a scientific first by transplanting into it the testicles and pituitary gland of a recently deceased man. A distinctly worryingly human animal is now on the loose, and the professor's hitherto respectable life becomes a nightmare beyond endurance. An absurd and superbly comic story, this classic novel can also be read as a fierce parable of the Russian Revolution.</em>

Not as good as _The Master and Margarita_ and sort of dated, but an interesting attack at the heart of communism. The dog becomes the most despicable socialist of them all!
