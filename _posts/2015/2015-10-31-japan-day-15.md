This was our final day in Kyoto. We had until lunch to walk around and then head up to an airport hotel in Narita for our final night.

The weather wasn't great, either.

For lunch we wandered around the Pontochô Kaburenjô area and found a very busy Gyukatsu place (Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu). It was amazing, they only really serve this tender beef steak that has been coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried, then you have a hot plate to cook it a bit more if you want. The boys loved it.

Afterwards, we headed to the station and headed up to Narita.
