#### Mockingjay (part III of The Hunger Games Trilogy)

<em>by Suzanne Collins</em>

Rating: ★★★★☆

<div class="book_synopsis">
Synopsis: <em> Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice. But now that she's made it out of the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge... The thrilling final instalment of this ground-breaking trilogy promises to be one of the most talked-about books of the year. </em>

Well, I loved books one and two. This was really pretty good, except for the last 100 pages or so... really from the point they entered the underground and headed for the President's mansion. (Potential spoiler...) I didn't see the point of all the deaths to the mutts underground, seemed like they were just paring back people... for no good reason. I also don't know why Prim had to show up either, or for it to go into 'morphling' mode... with the explosions. Since it is for Young Adults, why not let the three walk into a deserted mansion and find Snow and just let them be heros? Just seemed either rushed or confused.
