h4. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest

<em>by Stieg Larsson</em>

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>Salander is plotting her revenge - against the man who tried to kill her, and against the government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. But it is not going to be a straightforward campaign. After taking a bullet to the head, Salander is under close supervision in Intensive Care, and is set to face trial for three murders and one attempted murder on her eventual release. With the help of journalist Mikael Blomkvist and his researchers at Millennium magazine, Salander must not only prove her innocence, but identify and denounce the corrupt politicians that have allowed the vulnerable to become victims of abuse and violence. Once a victim herself, Salander is now ready to fight back. </em></div>

Ok, so the book spins a bit out of control with a few sub-plots that didn't need to exist (Berger's stalker, Salander's trips to Gibraltar)  but a great finish to the trilogy.
