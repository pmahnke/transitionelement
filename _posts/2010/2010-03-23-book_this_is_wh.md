#### This Is Where I Leave You

<em>by Jonathan Tropper</em>

Rating: ★★★☆☆

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>Poor Judd Foxman returns home early to find his wife in bed with his boss - in the act. He now faces the twin threats of both divorce and unemployment. His misery is compounded further with the sudden death of his father. He is then asked to come and 'sit Shiva' for his newly deceased parent with his angry, screwed up and somewhat estranged brothers and sisters in his childhood home. It is there he must confront who he really is and - more importantly - who he can become. Funny, moving, powerful and poignant.</em>

Well, I like Tropper. I have read [The Book of Joe](/assets/images/archives/2008/10/book_book_of_jo.html) and _How to Talk to a Widower_ and loved both. This one I liked less. There was a bit too much drama and perhaps a bit to like his other books (revisiting your past). But his characters are great and it is laugh-out-loud funny in parts. I think Angela liked it a lot more than I did... perhapa it cut too close to the bone in parts for me?
