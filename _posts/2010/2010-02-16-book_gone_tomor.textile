h4. Gone Tomorrow

<em>by Lee Child</em>

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;

<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>In the latest outing for Jack Reacher, Gone Tomorrow, Child’s resourceful hero is travelling in New York City, observing his fellow passengers on the subway. He’s aware that suicide bombers are easy to spot – they’re usually nervous, and (as he wryly notes) by definition they're first-timers. As an ex-law enforcer, Jack notices that of his five fellow travellers, one is distinctly giving out the signals that spell danger. Grand Central Station is approaching – will Jack act and save lives – including his own? But… what if he's wrong? This high voltage situation is the arresting curtain opener here, and the tension is screwed tighter, as Jack Reacher is pitched against the one of the most challenging threats he has come up against.</em></div>

Another good Jack Reacher book.  He takes apart an al Qaeda Sect in this one.
