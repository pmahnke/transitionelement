After missing out on the initial set of tickets, I saw a handful more go online that had been reserved for the soundboard, but were not used.  Angela and I found a sitter and met up at the Royal Festival Hall.  The opening act was by Philip Selway, for his first solo album.  He is the drummer for Radio Head, so had a really good, comfortable stage presence.  I was pretty impressed.

Wilco was amazing.  Angela didn't like the improve bits very much, but I thought it was better than last concert in November, that was a bit over the top with feedback.
