I have had these Sansom books sitting on my shelf for a year now and was only vaguely interested in reading them. However, my mother and friends Ann and Paul encouraged me to try them. Wow, they are amazing.

Historical fiction at its very best, I cannot recommend these enough -- great characters, interesting history, fascinating mystery.
