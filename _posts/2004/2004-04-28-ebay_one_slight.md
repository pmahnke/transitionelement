One Slightly Used Size 12 Wedding Gown. Only worn twice...
==========================================================

This is too funny, you just have to [read it](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4146756343) .

My favorite quote from it was:

> There was this one woman who wrote, "You should have covered your tattoos. People will be able to recognize you, like on America's Most Wanted." HELLO!!! I'm a guy selling a dress. I'm not wanted for war crimes.

*NOTE: I was alerted to this from another website... I should credit them... but I don't recall who it was... sorry*
