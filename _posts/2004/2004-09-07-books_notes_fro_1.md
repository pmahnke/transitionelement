**Notes from a Small Island**

_by Bill Bryson_

Bill Bryson takes a very funny trip through Great Britain as he prepares to move to the US after 20 years in the UK. He visits many of the places we have been (and live) with an interesting outsider/insider perspective.

I can't help but think that he must have a considerably different US version than the UK version because the language is so British...
