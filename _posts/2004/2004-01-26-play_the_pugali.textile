p. We saw this at the Soho with their &pound;5 ticket deal.

p. Of course, the train/tube pass was &pound;4.70 a piece... the wine at the theater was another &pound;5 and the babysitter was &pound;20....  so nothing is free!

p. However, the play was excellent.  Quiet hard to take it all in, but a modern morality play about historical record and "history", heroes & villains and love, empathy & betrayal.
