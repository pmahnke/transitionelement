**What text editor do I use/prefer?**

### Emacs

By far my favorite. Its installed on nearly all unix systems and my mac. It has nearly everything I require:

-   Unlimited file size
-   Powerful Search and Replace
-   PERL Mode
-   100% keyboard driven (unless you want to use X11)
-   keyboard macros
-   pretty strong with character sets, including UTF-8
-   available on nearly all Unix based systems

Here are some key commands for the uninitiated:

|                         |                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Control-x Control-c     | close/exit          |
| Control-x Control-s     | save                |
| Control-s               | search forward      |
| Control-r               | search backward     |
| Escape-x replace-string | search & replace    |
| Control-x k             | kill buffer         |
| Escape &lt;             | go to start of file |
| Escape &gt;             | go to end of file   |

### Ultra-Edit 32

For windows, its as close to Emacs as I have found that can use all the windows conversions. I know you can use Emacs on windows, but moving around the filesystem stinks. The things I like about Ultra-Edit:

-   FTP/SFTP built in... keeps me from having to learn VI on systems without Emacs
-   Regular Expressions for search & replace
-   Deduplicate sorting
-   Encoding conversions
-   HTML preview

### BBEdit

On my mac I use BBEdit. It is pretty amazing, but it don't find it as intuitive as Emacs or Ultra-Edit. It is also expensive to keep upgrading it.... which I hate... I don't mind shelling out a lot once, but after that, keep me on the upgrade path for cheap... Here is what I like:

-   Very good with HTML
-   Emacs keybindings
-   HTML preview on steroids
-   and the best.... tab to 4 spaces option... I love that!
