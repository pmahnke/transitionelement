**Notes from a Big Country**

_by Bill Bryson_

Because of the trip to Morocco, I got to do a lot of reading.

This book is a collection reprinted from the English newspaper, _The Mail on Sunday's_ magazine. It is loosely a set of observations of Bill Bryson on moving to Hanover, New Hampshire after 20 years in England. While some of the book clearly borrows concepts and notes from other books of his that I have read, it was really interesting... specially considering my relatively parallel life.

However, if you ask Angela, I completely embarrassed myself reading it. I was literally hysterical with laughter again and again. At one point a French couple next to me on an airplane, who spoke only a toddler's English, asked to read a chapter to see what was so funny and... even they laughed.
