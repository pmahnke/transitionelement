*A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail*
_by Bill Bryson_

p. Keeping with my pattern of reading nearly the entire body of an author in one furious stint, I read this Bryson book as well.

p. This book is a travel journal of Mr. Bryson walking the Appalachian Trail.  It is typical Bryson -- scholarly, sharply critical of government and corporate mis-management of the environment and the whole time funny.  However, this book was weaker than most, mostly because he and his side kick didn't really walk the whole trail and they didn't really run into many people.  Without that accomplishment or those conversations, its just to people struggling to go 15 miles a day through dense woods.

p. I will say, I didn't really notice this weakness until the final quarter of the book, so if you have any interest in Bryson, or the Appalachian Trail -- its worth a look.
