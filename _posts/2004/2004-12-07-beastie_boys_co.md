What a surprise! I hemmed and hawed... I didn't think that Angela would want to go again... I didn't think we should spend the money... Well Angela saw the tickets and went for it without thinking!

The concert was amazing, the B-Boys were great. Wembley's acoustics stink and it was way too loud in there, but that's another story.

The concert was a real mix of everthing they have done. They even did a set with songs from the instrumental album _The In Sounds from Way Out_ with Money Mark, which is without question -- one of the best albums ever created.

My personal favorites where:

- Root Down
- Pass the mic
- Skills to pay the bills
- Somethings got to give
- Open Letter to NYC
- 3MCs and 1DJ
- So Whatca Want
- Intergalactic

Not that I could really pick a bad one either.

If they are coming to a city near you -- Go!
