We saw this at the Soho with their £5 ticket deal.

Of course, the train/tube pass was £4.70 a piece... the wine at the theater was another £5 and the babysitter was £20... so nothing is free!

However, the play was excellent. Quiet hard to take it all in, but a modern morality play about historical record and "history", heroes & villains and love, empathy & betrayal.
