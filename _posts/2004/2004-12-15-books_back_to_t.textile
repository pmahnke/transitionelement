*Back to the Garden*
_Geoffrey Ross_

Geoffrey is my late uncle.  I was given this book right before he killed himself.  I had started it and spoke to him about it, but put it down when he died.

I think that he really wanted my opinion on the book.  The last time I saw him, I was in ninth grade and just read Sidharth by Herman Hesse for Non-Western World at USM (my high school).  He was pretty impressed that was something I read and was interested in.  Unfortunately we never got to speak much about his book or really anything.

I don't know why I picked up the book again.  I just saw it on the shelf and started reading.  Its actually pretty good, trying to explain Buddhism by having a modern man travel back in time to actually learn from the man himself.  It works pretty well, but clearly doesn't fit in a gendre and is therefore not really commercial.  But it did help me learn more...
