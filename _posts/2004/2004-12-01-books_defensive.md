**Defensive Design for the Web** : How to improve error messages, help, forms, and other crisis points

_by 37signals, Matthew Linderman, Jason Fried_

Pretty good book on defensive web design. I really knew everything in it, but it was good to remind and illustrate. The only frustrating thing is that I cannot affect a lot of the change on my own company's [website](http://europe.gartner.com).

If you haven't thought a _lot_ about web standards, accessibility and interface design, you _should_ read this...
