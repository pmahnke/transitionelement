Last night we went to our first Holland Park Opera this year. For the last two years we have gone to 2-3 a year. They are outside, but under a tent roof (good as it rained a little last night). They have a nice bar and its really pretty.

Last night we saw the excellent Strauss, _Die Fledermaus_.

Its a fun little opera about a comical revenge between two men. It was sung in English which made it more approachable than usual. Also, the cast hammed up the talking bits and the stereotypes. It was all really well done. I highly recommend going if you are in London.
