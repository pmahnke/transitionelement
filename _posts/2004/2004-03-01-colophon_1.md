We are running Apace 2.x and I am using [Moveable Type](http://www.moveabletype.com) as a CMT with Brad Chote's excellent [MT-Textile 2.x](http://www.bradchoate.com/mt-plugins/textile) and John Gruber's excellent [SmartyPants](http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/).

For the [travel journals](/assets/images/archives/travel/index.html) and am using a home-built CMS that also uses MT-Textile and SmartyPants and is the back-bone of some well known [sites](http://europe.gartner.com) ( *to name one* ).

All my scripts are written in Perl.

### Personal

I am an American living outside London. I am married and have two young children. I have been working on the web since 1995 doing everything from design to coding, but mostly as a Product Manager and/or Managing Editor.

I am very interested in clean, simple, web-standard information design and try to bring that to every place I work.
