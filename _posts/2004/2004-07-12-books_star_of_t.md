**The Start of the Sea**
*by Joeseph O'Conner*

Angela read this for book club and really liked it, so I gave it a go. Its about a murder on a ship taking Irish immigrants to America during the potato famine.

There are five main characters whose lives intertwine in ways they can not imagine and do not realize. Very interesting -- some good history, good suspense, feels old.
