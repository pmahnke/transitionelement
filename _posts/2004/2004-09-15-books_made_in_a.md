**Made in America**
*by Bill Bryson*

On our recent trip to Morocco, I re-read this book.

Its a very haphazard look at the evolution of American English and how it often retained older British phrasing than used in England, adapted words from nearly all immigrant and native languages and how modern technical, marketing and science has changed the language.

Funny and interesting.
