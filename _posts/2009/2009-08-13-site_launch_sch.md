This summer the web team has been very busy. We have had to work on three web sites simultaneously while doing more minor updates on a host of others. The biggest project has been creating a [site for parents to order online for our Book Clubs division](https://clubs-shop.scholastic.co.uk/).

We only had 11 weeks and had to update the [Children's Book Club site](https://clubs-kids.scholastic.co.uk/) and substantially rework the [Teacher's Book Club site](https://clubs-teachers.scholastic.co.uk/schoolbookclub/) as well as create a whole new shop.

We feel the end result is excellent and early sales are promising.
