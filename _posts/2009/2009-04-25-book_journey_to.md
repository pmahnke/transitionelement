Rating: ★★★★★

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>First published in 1932, "Journey to the End of the Night" is regarded as Celine's masterpiece. It is told in the first person and is based on his own experiences during the First World War; in French colonial Africa; in the USA - where he worked for a while at the Ford factory in Detroit - and later as a young doctor in a working class suburb in Paris. The novel gives a picture of those years as seen by an underdog.</em>

What can I say, the book is absolutely a masterpiece. Yes, it is dated and placed in a strange non-real/real world, but that takes nothing away from how powerful and amazing the book really is. The characters are so real, the emotions so strong. I can only imagine how much this book as influenced everything that has come afterwards.
