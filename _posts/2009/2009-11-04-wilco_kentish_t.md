Woman in crowd, "Play the hits!"

Jeff Tweedy, "Play the hits? Are you kidding? These are the hits."

The show was amazing. Only things I would have changed where:

1.  play Passenger Side for the wife
2.  turn down the lead guitar player a tad, he was great, but a bit too loud compared to everyone else.

Oh, and make getting home from Kentish Town a smidge easier for us...
