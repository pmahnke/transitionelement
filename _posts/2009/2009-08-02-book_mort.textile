h4. Mort (A Discworld Novel)

<em>by Terry Pratchett</em>

Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

<div class="book_synopsis">Synopsis: <em>Death comes to us all. When he came to Mort, he offered him a job. After being assured that being dead was not compulsory, Mort accepted. However, he soon found that romantic longings did not mix easily with the responsibilities of being Death's apprentice.</em></div>

OK

So, I never heard of the Diskworld series until Paula mentioned it for Owen about two years ago... however, I saw a used copy and picked it up to try on a long train ride.  Wow, what a book!

It's irreverent, funny amazing parody.

I still don't know if I was luck and hit a great book, or this is what Pratchett does, but I wish I knew about it sooner.
