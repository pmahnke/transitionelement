So it was really was a big Phase 2 're-launch' I guess. But it was a lot of work and a great project. We love all the MGM people. They are really lovely to work with and great things come out of that collaboration.

The site is for teen students learning English as a second language.

This year we have added a lot more to the 'pen pal' like Chattr application. Added a fun flash based set of activities to enhance our magazines. Also a points system with a great 'sticker' page, rewarding students for participation. Made all the homepages work through our CMS so they can be updated a lot more often. Completely reworked the registration process. Plus lots of enhancements to the teacher's search and loads more content. Here is what we did:

- Improved search
- CMS homepages
- Chat improvements
- Points for participation, leaderboards
- Who's online
- Student can launch activity
- Scholastic want to customise product copy on a per-shop basis
