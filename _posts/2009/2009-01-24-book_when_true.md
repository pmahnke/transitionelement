Really good; however, I would say the end was a bit disappointing. I don't want to give away the story, but...

-- so if you plan to read this stop --

-   why did Hesseth have to die the way she did? didn't help the plot, seemed really disappointing to lose her in such a meaningless way.
-   what was the Undying Prince trying to do? it was completely not explained?
-   why wasn't Calesta in the final scenes? seems unlikely
-   why would the Hunter showing the Mercia ruler the divining break his pack with hell, really?
-   why did the pilot from the Golden Glory have to die? really?

I could go on.

That said, I will read book three!
