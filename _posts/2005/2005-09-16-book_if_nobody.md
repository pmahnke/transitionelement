**If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things**

*by Jon McGregor*

Recommended by a friend to my wife, she read it and loved it. So, for a quick trip to New York, I read it ... and loved it. Its really as much a poem as a novel. It takes place in England -- somewhere, but really could be anywhere in the world.

The 'remarkable thing' about this book is that its all about the tiny observations, movements and changes that make the characters and plot move. There are no big sweeping statements or movements, its all about hundreds of fragments that are someone's day and life. Its like observing the fingering on the third violin, then the bow work of the tenth and the trench horn player turning and then realizing that its part of a symphony being played.

I highly recommend reading it.
