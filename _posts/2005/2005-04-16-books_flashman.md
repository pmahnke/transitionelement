#### Flashman and the Dragon

*by George MacDonald Fraser*

Rating: ★★★★☆

I read this book the first time about six years ago and picked up as a quick read between books, but I have to say, I think I love it even more than I did the first time.

What do I love about old Flashy? Well, first of all, I wish I could be Flashy. To lie, cheat and romp around the world like he does and get away with it would be too fun. If I couldn't be Flashy, then at least, I wish I could write like Mr. Fraser. No one I have ever read does as good a job of completely submerging their style into another character and time, its amazing.

You have to read it yourself to understand.
