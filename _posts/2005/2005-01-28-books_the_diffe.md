**The Difference Engine**

_by William Gibson & Bruce Sterling_

This is an excellent alternate history of the Victorian world if Charles Babbage had developed this thinking machine during the Industrial Revolution. ~~So far its pretty interesting... more to come...~~

Actually, I didn't like it. The end never really tied itself together. Who cares that Ada Byron figured out a programming error in the Babbage Engine? It wasn't clear why this was a problem, or why then entire first vignette mattered to the story...
