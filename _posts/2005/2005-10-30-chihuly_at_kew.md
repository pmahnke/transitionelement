All summer Kew has had a Dale Chihuly exhibit. As we go to Kew quite often with the boys, we have seen it in bits and pieces and have been impressed the individual works and impressed by how organic many of them look and how well they fit in with Kew's displays. However tonight was something altogether more special, a night time tour of all the pieces, all specially lit. It was really magically.

All the works really came alive. Some seemed to be strange new plants, some ornaments, some new chandeliers. From the Temperate House to the pond to the Princess of Wales House you walked on lit paths with entertainers along the way. We all loved it.

We have also never seen Kew so busy, even for their music events in the summer. The place was just heaving with families and groups of friends. I am glad we arrived early and missed 80% of the crowds.

If the exhibit ever comes to a garden near you, I strongly recommend going to any night events.
