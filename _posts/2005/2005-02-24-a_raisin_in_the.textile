Performed at the <em>Lyric Hammersmith</em>, this play was simply amazing and totally unexpected.  Unexpected because Angela told me it was a happy gospel-like musical -- and it isn't, also because it coming from 1959 completely destroyed my understanding of the black American condition at the time.  It talked about things in a familiar way that I didn't think were formalized until the late 60's or 70's.  

What are some of these things?

* intergenerational issues moving from slavery, share-cropping to relative freedom and civil rights
* complexity of developing a unique culture with known black American values and the issue of introducing traditional African heritage
* role of women within the black culture
* issues with roles of men inside a dominate white culture
* and much more...

I was very dark, complex and powerful.  Beautifully acted.  Hardly dated over the past 46 years...  Only the Pyrrhic victory at the end was a little to subtle for me... I am sure Hollywood would have made it far more dramatic if they made it today.

I would recommend that _everyone_ go and see this play.
