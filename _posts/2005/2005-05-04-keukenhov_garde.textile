For three years we have been trying to get to this corner of Holland to see the tulips.  All plans had been scuttled (alternate _work_ holiday, missed ferry boat, etc...)  But we finally made it, albeit a little late for the proper 'in the fields' season.  But the Keukenhof Gardens were at their peak.  What a wonderful trip.


*River of Flowers*

There were a couple of these around the park.  I can't even imagine how they planted them all.


*Hyacinth*

There were loads of fragrant hyacinth around the park.


*Red & Yellow Tulips*

The majority of the flowers at Keukenhov are tulips, over 7 million bulbs have been planted.


*Deep Purple*

I just loved the masses of dark flower heads.




*Queen of Sheba*

My wife's favorite!

More of the same.




*Fringe*

I don't even know the correct term for the ragged edges, but these were amazing and so different.


*Yellow Red Mix*

Just a lovely mix of colors.



*Tealip*

I have to look up the latin name for this, but very different looking.  They also came in yellow.


*Water*

There were a lot of water featured around the park, all dramatic in one way or another.


*Tulip Fields*

Just north of Lisse (N208) we saw these fields.  We were about two weeks out of season, but it was still amazing.
