For three years we have been trying to get to this corner of Holland to see the tulips.  All plans had been scuttled (alternate _work_ holiday, missed ferry boat, etc...)  But we finally made it, albeit a little late for the proper 'in the fields' season.  But the Keukenhof Gardens were at their peak.  What a wonderful trip.

|*Hyacinth*<br />There were loads of fragrant hyacinth around the park.|<a href="/assets/images/keukenhov_hyacinth.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/keukenhov_hyacinth-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Hyacinth" /></a>|

>>>|*Water*<br />There were a lot of water featured around the park, all dramatic in one way or another.|<a href="/assets/images/keukenhov_water.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/keukenhov_water-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Water Feature" /></a>|
