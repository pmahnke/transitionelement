p. *The Difference Engine*
_by William Gibson & Bruce Sterling_

p. This is an excellent alternate history of the Victorian world if Charles Babbage had developed this thinking machine during the Industrial Revolution.  -So far its pretty interesting... more to come...-

p. Actually, I didn't like it.  The end never really tied itself together.  Who cares that Ada Byron figured out a programming error in the Babbage Engine?  It wasn't clear why this was a problem, or why then entire first vignette mattered to the story...
