My good friends John & Kim Cook asked me which kid's books I liked the best.  I thought that I would start to capture a list of the ones that I like _and_ the kids like.

I will try to keep it up to date from time to time.

_Note: at the time I am writing this, my boys are three and five._

*Also, the list is in no particular order...*

h3. Jez Alborough

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK_jez-myfriendbear.jpg" width="300" alt="My Friend Bear" />

p. Jez is a wonderful illustrator.  His writing is pretty fun and clever too.  I highly recommend him.

* "My Friend Bear":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844284794/qid=1110187373/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-0714290-5554216

** A Duck gets stuck in the muck and people help him get out...




h3. Julia Donaldson & Axel Scheffler

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-room-on-the-broom.jpg" width="300" alt="Room on the Broom" />

p. These are all great.  I don't even mind reading them again and again.  We have even seen a the Gruffalo as a play.

* "Room on the Broom":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405021748/qid=1110187625/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_3_2/202-0714290-5554216
** Cute story of a nice witch that gets into trouble with a dragon and her friends help her out.
* "The Gruffalo":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333710932/ref=pd_sim_b_dp_3/202-0714290-5554216
** A very clever mouse proves he is the king of the forest.
* "The Smartest Giant in Town":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333963962/ref=pd_sim_b_dp_3/202-0714290-5554216

* "Monkey Puzzle":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333720016/ref=pd_sim_b_dp_1/202-0714290-5554216
** A little monkey need help finding his mom.




h3. Nick Butterworth

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-stories-jesus-told.jpg" width="300" alt="Stories Jesus Told" />

p. Nick's stories are really fun to read and occasionally interactive (i.e. you have to find the gold coins, or there is a maze).  The Percy books are in a wonderful make believe world of humans and talking animals.

* "Stories Jesus Told":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0551030720/qid=1110187981/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_3_6/202-0714290-5554216
** This is a great book, obviously Christian, but several parables brought to life that make sense to teach.
* "Percy the Parkeeper":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-0714290-5554216
** The boys love all the Percy books...  I think some are better than others, but they are all readable.
* "Q Pootle 5 in Space":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007119739/qid=1110193805/sr=1-10/ref=sr_1_11_10/202-0714290-5554216
** An extremely silly space story that they boys love.  Angela hates it, I think its fairly cleaver.




h3. Mick Inkpen

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-kippers-rainy-day.jpg" width="300" alt="Kipper" />

p. The boys love all the Kipper books.  They have tons of them for all ages, so choose carefully.  I am just giving one pointer, you can browse for the rest.

* "Kipper":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books-uk&field-author=Inkpen%2C%20Mick/202-0714290-5554216

h3. Roald Dahl

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-enourmous-crocodile.jpg" width="300" alt="The Enormous Crocodile" />

h3. Arnold Lobel

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-owl-at-home.jpg" width="300" alt="Owl at Home" />

p. These are some of the best stories ever.  I seriously choke up reading some of them.

*  "Owl at Home":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0064440346/qid=1110468553/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/103-7362928-1760618?v=glance&s=books

h3. Shel Silverstein

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-where-the-sidewalk-ends.jpg" width="300" alt="Where the Sidewalk Ends" />

p. These books of poems were my personal favorites in the 3rd grade.  I am very glad that my boys love them.

* "Where the Sidewalk Ends":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060256672/qid=1110476597/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-7328101-8570529

h3. Richard Scary

<img src="/assets/images/BOOK-best-mistake-ever.jpg" width="300" alt="The Best Mistake Ever! and Other Stories" />

p. Angela and I feel the same here.  Huckle Cat ( _see 'The Best Mistake Ever!'_ ) is great... all other books are *painful*.  But the kids love them... just wait until they are old enough to do it themselves.  If you have to ... just look for goldbug... makes it a little better.

* "The Best Mistake Ever! and Other Stories":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0394968166/qid=1110471152/sr=1-30/ref=sr_1_30/103-7362928-1760618?v=glance&s=books

* "Cars and Trucks and Things That Go":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307157857/qid=1110470966/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-7362928-1760618




h3. OTHER GOOD ONES

* <img src="/assets/images/BOOK-something-else.jpg" width="120" class="inline-image" alt="Something Else" /> "Something Else":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140549072/qid=1110469565/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/202-0714290-5554216 by Kathryn Cave
We even saw a play of this.  A good story with a great message.
* <img src="/assets/images/BOOK-pig-a-pancake.jpg" width="120" class="inline-image" alt="If You Give a Pig a Pancake" /> "If You Give a Pig a Pancake":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060266864/qid=1110469735/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/202-0714290-5554216 by Laura Joffe Numeroff
A perfect circle and very cute and fun.

I think this is the best version of all.
* <img src="/assets/images/BOOK-mr-happy.jpg" width="120" class="inline-image" alt="Mr Happy" /> "Mr Men Books":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Roger%20Hargreaves/103-7362928-1760618 by Roger Hargreaves
We own the entire box set.  They are cute and quick reads, each teaching about something good.
* <img src="/assets/images/BOOK-is-your-mama-a-llama.jpg" width="120" class="inline-image" alt="Is Your Mama A Llama?" /> "Is Your Mama A Llama?":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590259385/qid=1110476478/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-7328101-8570529 by Deborah Guarino

h3. Anthologies

Its loosely based on Noah's Ark, each night a different animal tells a different story.  It isn't religous at all, but very fun.
