#### The Sum of All Fears

_by Tom Clancy_

Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆

After having read [Red Rabbit](/archives/2005/12/books_red_rabbi.html) and not being too happy with it, I decided to get this from the library. I had heard good things about the book, even though Ben Affleck was Jake Ryan in the movie (which I refused to see on those grounds, in fact, I wasn't too happy that Harrison Ford stole the role from Alex Baldwin in the first place, but that is another post I should write).

This book was much better. Even more outrageous in terms of feasibility, it was far more interesting to follow. In fact the last 200 pages or so was a sprint to finish -- I couldn't put it down. There were some thin plot points, but not many. He didn't deal with how the president was removed from office so quickly, killed off a bad submarine captain a little too easily, etc... but generally it was believable, scary and so well written. I really enjoyed it.
