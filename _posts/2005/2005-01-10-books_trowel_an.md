**Trowel and Error**
*by Alan Titchmarsh*

This was a Christmas present from Angela. I loved Alan on <em>Ground Force</em> and <em>Gardner's World</em>. Now he is doing more documentaries, but very gentle, well spoken, intelligent man. This book is his memoirs and its a well spoken, gentle, intelligent book... like you would expect.
