*Would you work for beer?*

#### I OFFICIALLY WORK FOR BEER

That's right, I have a completely informal deal to format and send out the monthly [Real Ale's](https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505231555&action=getlisting) [newsletter](https://stmargarets.london/static/realale/newsletter.html).

bq.. Working for beer sounds good to me - a six pack retails at {-L}15.00 a box on average, how does that sound?

Sound *good* to me ... very good.
