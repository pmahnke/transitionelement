**The Five People You Meet in Heaven**

_by Mitch Albom_

A quick, joyful read. Not my normal kind of book, but Angela and my mother both liked it, so I started it on holiday in Paris.

It is about a man who dies and in heaven meets five people somehow connected to his life, that _cleanse_ him and prepare him for entering heaven. The man must learn a lesson from each person before moving on.

Very powerful and good story telling.
