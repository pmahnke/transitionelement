Well, as I shared [here](/assets/images/archives/2005/06/apple_with_inte.html) my wonderful Apple G4 died recently a horrible death... a memory chip and one of the two CPUs kicked the bucket... and the cost of repair was greater than the value of a new machine -- naturally.

Of course I didn't even want a new system, but with my job situation (aka I am soon to be unemployed) and everything [else](https://stmargarets.london) going on, I really missed it more and more everyday. So I finally broke down and got a refurbished one that was 30% off (naturally today they dropped to 34% off the day it arrived).

It seems a little faster, but the best bit is that its about 50% quieter than the jumbo jet fans of my last one!

Now I need to get some more memory!
