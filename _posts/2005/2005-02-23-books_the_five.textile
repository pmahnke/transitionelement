p. *The Five People You Meet in Heaven*
_by Mitch Albom_

p. A quick, joyful read.  Not my normal kind of book, but Angela and my mother both liked it, so I started it on holiday in Paris.  

p. It is about a man who dies and in heaven meets five people somehow connected to his life, that _cleanse_ him and prepare him for entering heaven.  The man must learn a lesson from each person before moving on.  

p. Very powerful and good story telling.
