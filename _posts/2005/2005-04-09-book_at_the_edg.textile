*At the Edge of Honor*
_by Robert Macomber_

My father-in-law loaned me this book.  He had heard the author speak recently and was impressed with him.  Apparently he has lectured at Annapolis on guerrilla tactics and is a sailor.

I assumed it would be pretty boring, as it deals with a fictional captain in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron during the Civil War.  Not that it wouldn't be well written, but really, how much happened there...  

Surprisingly, a lot happened and the book is very well written.  While some of the story-lines weren't as interesting, I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I am looking forward to read the next two books in the series.
