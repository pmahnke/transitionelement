p. We have been luck enough to travel around a fair amount.  I have been very slow to add these trips to the weblog; however, its a fair amount of work.  

p. I share the pictures and the comments because sites like these have been invaluable in helping us plan trips.  I just want to give back a little. 

p. I will slowly be adding many of the ones that were on the old site and adding a few of our newer trips.  If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email (peter&#64;&#x74;&#114;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x73;&#105;&#116;&#x69;&#x6F;&#110;&#x65;&#x6C;&#101;&#x6D;&#101;&#x6E;&#x74;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;) or write a comment.
