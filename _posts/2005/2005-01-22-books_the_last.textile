p. *The Last Lighthouse Keeper*
_by Alan Titchmarsh_

p. This was a Christmas present from Angela.  This was the first novel of Alan's that I have read.  I have to say, I really liked it, even thought it was completely not like anything I would normally pick-up.  I won't describe it, but its worth a quick read.
