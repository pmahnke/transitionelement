**The Last Lighthouse Keeper**

_by Alan Titchmarsh_

This was a Christmas present from Angela. This was the first novel of Alan's that I have read. I have to say, I really liked it, even thought it was completely not like anything I would normally pick-up. I won't describe it, but its worth a quick read.
