Congratulations to the team ( *including my brother* ) at Smith Barney on reducing their homepage size from over 350k. They have moved to a far lighter and faster 80k that very *nearly* validates and uses a pure CSS layout (they have also overhauled their portfolio pages.)

They still have a ways to go, but clearly they are on the path towards CSS driven layout. I know it hasn't been easy for them as they had to abandon support for certain browsers and touch a lot of code in a lot of different system, but the ROI is real and the site look good.
