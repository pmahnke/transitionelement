  Loved this book... Angela read it and passed it over... when she does this, I know it is good.  It was funny, uplifting and interesting.  I don't know why I hadn't heard of it, but I recommend it.

#### The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry

<em>by A Novel</em>

Rating: ★★★★☆

<div class="book_synopsis" markdown="1">
Synopsis: <em>Meet Harold Fry, recently retired. He lives in a small English village with his wife, Maureen, who seems irritated by almost everything he does, even down to how he butters his toast. Little differentiates one day from the next. Then one morning the mail arrives, and within the stack of quotidian minutiae is a letter addressed to Harold in a shaky scrawl from a woman he hasn't seen or heard from in twenty years. Queenie Hennessy is in hospice and is writing to say goodbye.

Harold pens a quick reply and, leaving Maureen to her chores, heads to the corner mailbox. But then, as happens in the very best works of fiction, Harold has a chance encounter, one that convinces him that he absolutely must deliver his message to Queenie in person. And thus begins the unlikely pilgrimage at the heart of Rachel Joyce's remarkable debut. Harold Fry is determined to walk six hundred miles from Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed because, he believes, as long as he walks, Queenie Hennessey will live.</em>

Loved this book... Angela read it and passed it over... when she does this, I know it is good. It was funny, uplifting and interesting. I don't know why I hadn't heard of it, but I recommend it.
