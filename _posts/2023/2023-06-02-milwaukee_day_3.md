Today we met Brad for lunch at [Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria
](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zdRwouX7PdHCiJT99). It was great and really good to see him.

Then we went back and helped mom pack.

In the evening, we had an awesome dinner with Aaron and Pam at [Birch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v4kCgFpRNGQ5WWpt6).
