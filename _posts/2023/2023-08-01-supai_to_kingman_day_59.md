Again, because of the heat, we headed out of Supai at 5am.

Four and a half hours later, we walked the ten miles and 3,500 feet up to our car. Then we drove 60 miles back to Route 66, then two more hours to [Kingman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DAu24dAqbXJUuBV87).

Basically a pit stop to get ready for our flight home tomorrow!
