On our first day, we were jet-lagged. But we had some breakfast and headed to the [Imperial Palace's Chidorigafuchi Moat](https://goo.gl/maps/hs9TLZ818E7rqk7C8) to see the end of the cherry blossoms. There were far gone; in fact, a team took down all the lights. However, enough was left to get a real feel for it all. We will have to keep trying; hopefully, it will be better further north.

After walking around the moat, we stayed on the east side of the palace and headed to Ginza to check out [Muji's flagship store](https://goo.gl/maps/1UqkkaySkgbaRHrr8). It is always fun to poke around all the floors, and Owen found a few pieces of clothing.

It was a bit early, but we decided to have yakitori for lunch at a place I had read about, in a railway arch. Cheap and good. To follow that up, we went to a fancy tea at Ippudo, where Owen was keen to buy a few bags of Sencha. It was a bit of a wait, but the tea and the place were relaxing.

We had heard about TeamLabs back in London and booked tickets to give structure to our first day. The [TeamLab Planets exhibition](https://goo.gl/maps/iym2T5gZfed8YWdf9) is a bit far from everything, but very worth going to. It is a big, sensory experience with about ten rooms to wander through. Beautifully done and handles large crowds well. We highly recommend it.

Afterwards, we returned to Shinjuku for drinks and dinner at a tonkatsu restaurant near our hotel.
