Since we waited too long to get tickets, and it was over school half-term, we ended up having to take a really circuitous route to Japan to save money. We justified it because it included an overnight stay in Munich, which allowed us to see some family.

So we said good bye to Ryan, who had to go back to Uni and headed off, very late, to Munich. We arrived around 11pm and went straight to bed.

We all packed very lightly, with a single bag each.
