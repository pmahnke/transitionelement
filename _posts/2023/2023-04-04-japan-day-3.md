We had about five hours to spend at Inchon Airport. Shattered, I attempted to sleep, but we wandered aimlessly, ate fried chicken, and watched actors parade around the airport dressed as medieval Korean royalty.

When we arrived at Narita Airport, we had to go through a relatively painless but lengthy process of proving we were Covid-safe (which ends on 5 May 2023). Then we picked up the Mifi router we pre-ordered, our three-day subway pass, and our Skyline ticket to Tokyo.

Once at our hotel, we wandered out for street food and drinks and went to bed.
