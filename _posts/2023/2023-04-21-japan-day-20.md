Today was our last full day in Japan. We started off marching around Ginza, looking for a tea house that served drinks before noon. We failed.

Five kilometres later, we went to a fantastic bakery, [Johan](https://goo.gl/maps/DZpp7iRq9tULmPv1A), in a high-end department store and sat in their roof garden â€” a good choice.

Afterwards, we went on a tour of the [Imperial Palace](https://goo.gl/maps/fu3Cmn2GqAN55xfc8). Then we went to a tea house and enjoyed a final pot of sencha.

For the evening, we went to [High Five](https://goo.gl/maps/eNBGozrWJUsqgV9XA), a bar recommended by an old friend, Rick Himes. So good. Drinks were followed by one last dinner and a long subway ride to a hotel by Narita airport.

A great trip!
