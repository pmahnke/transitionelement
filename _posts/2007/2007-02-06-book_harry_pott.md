#### Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

*by J. K. Rowling*

Rating: ★★★★☆

Synopsis: *It is Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts and there are spells to be learnt, potions to be brewed and Divination lessons to be attended. Harry is expecting these: however, other quite unexpected events are already on the march.*

I love the whole series and can't believe I used to look down my nose at adults reading these book on the train.
