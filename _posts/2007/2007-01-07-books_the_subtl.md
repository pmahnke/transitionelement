#### The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials)

_by Philip Pullman_

Rating: ★★★★☆

Synopsis: _There are worlds beyond our own - the Compass will show the way... The second novel in Philip Pullman's epic HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy. The first, NORTHERN LIGHTS, is now the stunning motion picture THE GOLDEN COMPASS, made by New Line Cinema and Scholastic Media. THE SUBTLE KNIFE brings Lyra to an eerie city where she meets a mysterious boy - a murderer. Will's fate is strangely linked with hers, and together they must find a powerful and secret object which people from many worlds would kill to possess._

An amazing new world is opened, everything is set in motion. Including one or two too many sub-plots -- but still good.
