#### Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

_by Paul Torday_

Rating: ★★★★½

Very cleverly written as a series of journal entries, letters and newspaper articles, this is the story of a man’s journey towards faith and love wrapped up in the tale of building a salmon fishery in the Yemen desert tied up in the UK's middle eastern politics.
