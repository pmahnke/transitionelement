excerpt: |
  Tuesday, 30 August 2022\n\nI chickened out of climbing the cables up Half Dome, but Angela wanted to go it. To avoid the crowds, we got up early and walked over. Sure enough, it was pretty empty and Angela had a fairly easy time. She said it wasn’t as good a view as Cloud’s Rest, but impressive. After the climb, we walked thousands of feet down to Happy Idles and the end. We bumped into our fried Laura on the way as well. But we had to rush to the bus to Mammoth and didn’t linger in Yosemite valley. But we are done. Tough and wonderful.
