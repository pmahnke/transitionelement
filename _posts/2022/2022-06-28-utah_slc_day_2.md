Today, we visited Temple Square. We were asked a lot of questions about our religious upbringing and views by 18 year old women. It was awkward.

The Temple itself is undergoing a multi-year earthquake protection enhancement, but we did tour the Tabernacle.

We also went shopping for a bigger tent for the national park camping we are doing. Our hiking tent is too small to be comfortable. We found a nice one at Walmart for cheap. We also picked up some cooking things like plastic plates, cutlery, etc... And food for the start.
