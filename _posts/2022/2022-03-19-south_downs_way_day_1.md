_Winchester to East Meon_

We decided to attempt the [South Downs Way](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/hampshire/south-downs-way-complete) as a training hike for our trip to the USA. We figured it was fairly close to where we live and that we could do it over two or three weekends. It turned out that the trains were a big problem for us returning home each leg, but I am glad we did it.

The South Downs Way is an ancient path following a chalk ridge line that was the former edge of the sea. It has been farmed so long that it has a very unique biosphere with butterflies, insects and plant that only exist here.

We got up early and took the train to Winchester to start the South Downs Way. We acted as tourists a bit and visited the cathedral and the market in town. We picked up some food for lunch as well.

The walk out of town was a bit convoluted, but we got there.

Then we walk along mostly farm fields and [Old Winchester Hill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqV1wGMSstV8CNTF8) an iron age hill fort.

We spent the night in the [South Downs Eco Lodge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UyP1SB6brvdT8HQc9) with exactly one other person. The place would hold around 100 people. They had a big kitchen and we made some food there.

Great weather.
