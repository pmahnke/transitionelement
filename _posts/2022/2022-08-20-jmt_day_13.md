excerpt: |
  Tuesday, 16 August 2022\n\nWe started with Muir Pass. It was really pretty with a fast stream and several lakes on the way up. It was still, so the lakes mirrored the mountains behind. At the top is the iconic round Muir Hut with a conical roof. The decent to Evolution Lakes was long and often steep. The lakes were pretty and we had lunch there, but it started raining.  From the lakes it was a long decent down the valley to the Evolution Creek. We stayed just past the ranger station on the meadow with about 15 miles grazing for a pack camp group. In the evening we had our first campfire and a nice chat with everyone.

We started with Muir Pass. It was really pretty with a fast stream and several lakes on the way up. It was still, so the lakes mirrored the mountains behind. At the top is the iconic round Muir Hut with a conical roof. The decent to Evolution Lakes was long and often steep. The lakes were pretty and we had lunch there, but it started raining.  From the lakes it was a long decent down the valley to the Evolution Creek. We stayed just past the ranger station on the meadow with about 15 miles grazing for a pack camp group.
