### 31 July to 11 August 2024

#### Chamonix to Chamonix - 170 km (106 miles) - 12 days

The Tour de Mont Blanc is a _must do_ hike, if you live in Europe. You know it will be busy and booking huts nearly impossible, but the views are worth it. For us this was true. Our only real issue was the heat. We had very sunny and very warm weather. I personally struggled with some of the climbs in the heat, in fact, we ended one evening early.

### Huts or hotels or camping

You can do this trail doing any combination of staying in huts, hotels or camping. We decided to do mostly huts as that is special bit of the TMB. We did stay in a hotels in Courmeyur, Champex Lac, and Col de la Forclaz, but you sort of have to in these location. Almost all other hotels would require that you leave the trail and go down to the valleys. This will add a fair bit of walking. The same for camping, all the sites are down in the valleys. And the huts are fun, you eat family style and you get to chat with like-minded hikers. They all serve beer and snacks.

Also, obviously, if you sleep in huts and hotels, you don't need to bring camping gear other thank what you need to alk and a sleeping bag liner, much lighter.
