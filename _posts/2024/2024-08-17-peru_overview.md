Angela and I have wanted to go to Peru for ages; now that we are retired, we put together a two-month trip to see as much of the country as possible, but still at a reasonable pace. We also wanted to do a few guided trips, specifically:

1. An eight-day trip to the Manu Rainforest
2. The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu
3. A ten-day circuit of the Cordillera Huayhuash

For the rest of the trip, we would either manage on our own or buy one-day guided tours for various sites, like the Scared Valley near Cusco.

### Money
Most places accept credit cards (Master Card and Visa, less American Express). Cash is pretty common as well and easy to get at ATMs. We found a national bank that always worked for us and just kept going there. Withdrawing cash felt very safe. Often, there were guards, and even if there wasn't a guard, it still felt fine.

You will have to tip guides in cash, and smaller places might not take cards, so it is good to have some on you.

### Mobile phones
Since we had been in the country for so long, I got a local SIM card with unlimited data. It was very reasonable in price, but it was complicated to get, pay the monthly fee, and cancel. We rarely had to make an actual phone call, so I think that next time, I would just get a travel SIM with mobile data. Angela did this and was just as happy. It was only marginally more expensive. She used [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/).

### Getting around
We mostly used buses. In Lima, we even used the local buses as Google Maps could plan routes and stops well. We used tourist buses for intercity travel, mainly from Crus del Sur, but occasionally used other companies as they didn't go everywhere we needed. We also did two internal flights that were very straightforward to figure out.

Occasionally, we used cabs and used Uber and InDrive apps to call them. They were reasonable and felt safe; we just didn't need them very often. We could walk nearly everywhere and picked central hotels.
### Hotels
We used Booking.com for almost all our hotels. We did pre-book a few of them, but we generally only booked places a few days before travelling. It was the end of the tourist season, and there was a lot of availability.

### Tours
We had pre-booked the three main tours before visiting Peru and planned the rest of the trip around them. For our day trips and smaller trips, like to Amanatani Island in Lake Titikaka and Colca Canyon, we just found companies online or by walking into offices of the many tour companies in most towns.

As much of the economy relies on tourism, it’s easy to plan a few days ahead for most activities. However, for the Inca Trail, you need to book at least a month in advance due to strict restrictions on the number of people allowed on the trail.Angela and I have wanted to visit Peru for ages.

### Money
Most places in Peru accept credit cards (MasterCard and Visa, with American Express being less common). Cash is widely used and easy to obtain from ATMs. We found a national bank that consistently worked for us, and withdrawing cash felt safe. There were often guards present, and even in their absence, we felt secure.

You will need cash to tip guides, and smaller establishments may not accept cards, so it's wise to have some cash on hand.

### Getting Around
We mostly relied on buses for transportation. In Lima, we even utilized local buses because Google Maps effectively planned our routes and stops. For intercity travel, we primarily used tourist buses, mainly from Cruz del Sur, but occasionally opted for other companies if they served routes we needed. We also had two internal flights that were very straightforward to navigate.

We occasionally used cabs and rideshare apps like Uber and InDrive. They were affordable and felt safe, although we didn't need them very often since we could walk nearly everywhere, often choosing central hotels.

We primarily used Booking.com for our hotel reservations. While we pre-booked a few places, we typically arranged accommodations just a few days before traveling. Since it was the end of the tourist season, there was plenty of availability.

We pre-booked our three main tours before arriving in Peru and adjusted the rest of our itinerary around them.

### Power
Peru uses the two-prong plugs common in the USA. You can purchase inexpensive USB adapters everywhere.

### Language
While some locals speak English, knowing a few Spanish phrases is very helpful. As Angela speaks Spanish, we navigated our communication fairly well, with Google Translate assisting us for those extra 15% of the time we needed it.

### Food
Peruvian food is of excellent quality and generally reasonably priced. Lima is home to the world’s best restaurant, but it is quite expensive. Outside of major cities, food tends to be moderately priced or inexpensive. The cuisine features many Asian influences, with dishes like fried rice and soy sauce being common.

In addition to local fare, you’ll find plenty of burgers, pizzas, and Chinese restaurants in most towns.

### Costs
Peru is relatively inexpensive for American and European tourists. You can find affordable options, including hostels and street food, or choose higher-end experiences—all at reasonable prices.

| Laundry               |        ~$5 per kilo |

### Altitude
Since many people ask about altitude, I want to address this, especially for those planning to hike. The Andes are quite high, and most tourist towns in Peru are positioned at high altitudes. It’s crucial to acclimate gradually. We took our time moving from sea level in Peru to higher areas like Arequipa, Puno, and Cusco. I understand that we had the luxury of time, but even on a week-long trip, I recommend completing the Inca Trail after spending at least two days in Cusco.

I hope this information helps!
