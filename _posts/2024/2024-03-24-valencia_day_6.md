Today was a bit of a fail.

We decided to head out of town to an artichoke festival that was open all weekend. However, after a complicated set of buses, it turns out the festival didn’t actually start until the evening and the artichokes were only on Sunday.

The programme and website didn’t mention this. Loads of others people were equally confused.

Really poor marketing. We headed back and enjoyed the rest&#064;of the day in town.
