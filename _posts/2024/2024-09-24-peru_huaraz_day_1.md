  We flew up to Huaraz from Lima this morning. We spent the rest of the day just walking around. It’s a very lively place and a lot of little restaurants.

We spent the rest of the day just walking around. It’s a very lively place and a lot of little restaurants. We went to a lovely pizza place for dinner as well.
