More errands today.

We also went to a briefing for the Inka Trail and another for the Scared Valley day tour.

But we did manage to get to a football match, Cusco vs Comerciantes Unidos. It was very interesting; great, but a small number of fans. Dozens of types of food and drink. And a great fan lead brass band.
