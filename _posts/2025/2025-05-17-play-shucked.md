We went to the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre for the first time to see the Tony Award-winning musical, Shucked.

Ann and Paul came as well.  It was really fun and funny.  The venue is great with a lot of food and drink and comfortable seating.  The play was 'corny' but pretty clever, albeit a mostly predictable plot. The songs were all pretty good.  There was a lot of off-colour humour, but we found it clever and funny.

If you are looking for something fun to go see this summer, head over.
