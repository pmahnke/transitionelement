Tonight we had dinner with John & Kim cook at Wu's Wontons and then went back to their apartment to talk more. John brought some amazing Rieslings to Wu's and the meal was great.

We had a lot to catch-up on, so we spent a good few hours at their home, hearing all about their kids, families, life and more!
