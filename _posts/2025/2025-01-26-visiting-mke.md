From the 15 to 26 January, I went to Milwaukee to visit my mom.  She had pneumonia over Christmas and wasn't feeling great, so I went to just check-in and give her some company.  My brother John came for a week at the end as well.

Mom was just pretty tired, but doing fine by the time I arrived.  It was super cold, so I didn't get out too much.  Mostly to walk Diki and go food shopping.

I also kept myself busy helping re-order the kitchen and toss out a lot of old food that was around from the old Shepard house.  I also put away all the Christmas decorations and cleaned up a lot of mom's electronic life.

I think everything was a lot more logically organised and tidier when I was done.

John helped clean-up a lot of the papers in other rooms. Together we also got mom's car emissions tested and paid the licence. 

We also visited my high school friend, Brad and got to eat all my favourite Milwaukee foods.
