_April 4, 1940 - June 20, 2025 - Orange City, Florida_


Almut Haswell, 85, of Orange City, Florida, passed away peacefully on June 20, 2025. Almut was born on April 4, 1940, in Bochum, Germany, to Annemarie and Erich Haberkamp, the fourth of five daughters. 

From age 8 to 18, Almut competed as a gymnast.  After high school, she trained as an Orthoptist in Switzerland and moved to New York in 1964 to begin her career in New York and New Jersey.  Shortly after moving to the USA, Almut met and married Carleton (Toby) Haswell in 1966.  Together, they raised two daughters, Angela Mahnke and Robin Taft, in Packanack Lake, Wayne, New Jersey.

Starting in the 1980s, Almut and Toby lived and worked overseas for many years, including England, Egypt, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Australia, Mexico, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

After years of living abroad, they retired to Punta Gorda, Florida and spent many years cruising on their sailboat, “Footloose”, around Florida and the Caribbean.  Almut always loved visiting family and friends, travelling, theater, reading, puzzles, mahjong, and cards. 

She is survived by Toby, her husband of 59 years; her daughters, Angela and Robin; her grandchildren, Owen Mahnke, Ryan Mahnke, Kayla Taft, and Julia Taft; and her sisters, Dr. Gunhild Querengässer and Mechthild Haberkamp. 

Almut’s warmth, curiosity, and sense of adventure will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved her.
