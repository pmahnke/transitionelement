Next was a visit to the McCullough's in New London, New Hampshire. We spent two nights in their huge, rambling house. We visited all the local lakes, Erica's consignment shop, the King Arthur Flour Company, and the Montshire Museum of Science - where we were the only childless adults.

We played, and lost badly to Erica, Boggle.  We had a tour of the gardens from Tim. And we met two of the three sons.
