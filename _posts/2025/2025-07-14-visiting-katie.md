For our final stop in Massachusetts, we spent two night with the St Germain's in Holden. Jon Paul and the kids were largely away, so we spent most of our time with Katie, Angela's childhood friend.

We toured Holden and Wooster and spent a lot of time just catching up. Their dog is really old and not doing well health-wise. I mentioned that it reminded me of Dogpool from Deadpool & Wolverine, which we immediately had to watch.

The last evening we were there, Jon Paul and all the kids made an appearance. It was nice to see the kids again all as young adults.
