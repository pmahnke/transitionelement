We met up with our friend Keith for dinner in New York.

It was great to catch up; however, the restaurant was so loud that our ageing ears could barely deal with it. But it was good to get an update on Heidi, the kids and Keith's new job.

Oh, that's a very old picture of Keith. He is more grey and skinnier now.
