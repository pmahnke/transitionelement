Our final visit of our tour to the North East, was with the Delue's in New Jersey. Both Judy and Jerry are childhood friends of Angela's from school and sea scouts.

We met Judy and Jerry at a pub near Sparta, NJ.  After lunch we headed to Green Pond, where Jerry's family has had a home for generations.  We spent a few hours chatting by the pond, eating ice cream and catching up.

We even met Kyle and his wife Olivia.
