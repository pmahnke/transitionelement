Today I turned 56.

It was a pretty quiet day as we are just back from Nepal.  Ryan arrived from India/Sri Lanka and wasn't up for coming over.

We had a nice dinner and I got many nice gifts, including:

- waterproof headphones from Ryan
- a margarita kit from Owen
- booze from John and Dee
- nick & nora glasses from mom
- magnetic notepads from Angela

Thank you all.
