Our first stop in Massachusetts was with Angela's cousin Heather's family, the Yountz's in Needham Heights. The last time we saw Heather, she was around 14 years old at a Haswell reunion in Wisconsin, a year or so after our wedding.  

It was great to catch up again and meet her amazing husband and family with three nice kids. They are keen travellers and have had exciting careers.

We really enjoyed the time together.
