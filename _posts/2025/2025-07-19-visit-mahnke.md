To bookend our trip to the North East we stayed at John & Dee's in Manhattan. We tried to keep away from their weekends, but had a lot of nice days and evenings to catch-up. 

We also moved the cocktail website to [The Barspoon](https://thebarspoon.com) and to celebrate, we had a _lot_ of cocktails, including a night of champagne cocktails. John also gave me a bag full of spices for the dinner at Almut's family dinner. 

Thank you brother and sister-in-law!
