  About our trip to China from February to March 2025
---

This was my third trip to China, Angela's second, and Owen's first. Angela and I had visited in 1997 with my (Chinese-speaking) brother and mom in 1997. The main reason for going this time was to see the Harbin Ice & Snow Festival, but also to see what the New China looked like after the economical growth of the past 30 years. Initially, I was a bit worried that it would be 'ruined' and that all the real beauty would have been torn down for urbanisation and progress. Gladly, this hadn't happened, China has moved into the modern era more deftly and and comprehensively than I could had imagined. They have maintained their heritage, but created a very modern society with high speed trains, extensive metro systems, and a 5G powered, mobile friendly, nearly cashless society.

### Using a guide with a driver

So in the past, we used a tour agency for most of the trip. This time we decided to as well. It is nice to have a driver to get you around, and a guide to navigate you to the sites you want to see as well as help you understand what you are seeing. Also, the cost isn't too bad still. Having finished the trip, I definitely think we could have done it on our own, it would have just been a lot harder to get all the trains arranged, pick restaurants, get taxis, and tickets to venues. In the end, I think we would have seen and done fewer things.

We managed fine with the subway and food in Harbin without a guide, but even getting to a hotel with a map and Chinese name of the hotel was a struggle.

### Apps and money

The real issue with solo travel is the lack of good bilingual apps to help. Google Maps (and all of Google) are blocked and even with a VPN have little information. Apple maps is a poor substitute and Baidu Maps are great, but in Chinese only, so nearly impossible to navigate. The other issue is paying for things. You need to have WeChat and AliPay up and running to be able to do anything; however, the are times it still failed without a mainland Chinese bank account. So bring some money. Also, if you do use a guide and driver, you will need to tip them in cash, so plan ahead - think approximately 100 yuan (£10) per day for the driver and 300 yuan (£30) per day for the guide.

As for apps, we use the following daily:

- **AliPay** for nearly all purchases, you need set this up ahead of time. To pay, you either show your QR code to the vendor who scans it, or you scan their QR code. I never knew which option a shop was using.
- **WeChat** for messaging with each other and our guides. Also, in restaurants, it is often the easiest way to order, look at a menu and get that menu translated to English (often it isn't great as you don't know 'Ants walking on a stick' is really fried eggplant in a black bean sauce with minced pork). WeChat also does the best at translating a printed menu or document. And you can pay with WeChat if you set it up; however, I had some issues with this if it was an individual you were paying and then it would often ask for a debit, that you can't do as a foreigner.
- **Baidu Translate** for translating text, but even better for translating voice, both for you and your Chinese counterpart. And the Chinese mostly know this app and can use it with you to have a 'conversation'.
- **Didi** for Uber like cars/taxis. Didi is cheap and pretty easy if you know exactly where you want to go. You can pay with AliPay as well.
- **Baidu Maps** for maps. We did occasionally use this, but it was hard without knowing Chinese characters.

_Note:_ you need to install all these before to go to China. If you have a VPN, you _might_ be able to there, but it isn't as easy.

### Mobile data and VPNs

You will want to get mobile data. Wifi is available in a lot of places, but it isn't great and if you are outside, it likely won't work. We used [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/), which was pretty reasonable and mostly works like a VPN, at least we had access to a lot of apps and sites beyond the Great Firewall. We paid $28 for 10GB and that lasted us the 20 days, but make sure you turn off any heavy data using apps like mobile backups on Google Photos.

As for a VPN, you might want to get one for use on mobile data, but definitely for wifi at your hotel. We found that only [AstrillVPN](https://www.astrill.com/) seemed to work over wifi, NordVPN, TunnelBear and GoogleVPN just didn't connect. It is pricy, but you only need it for a month.

### Getting around

Most of the larger cities (and most of them are large) have extensive metro systems. We mostly walked or used these. Getting tickets is easy. You can either get a 'transport card' on AliPay or Apple Wallet and just present a QR code entering and leaving the station, or you can get a ticket at your initial station at a machine. These are available in English and you just select your line and then end station and pay with AliPay or WeChat.

You can also use Didi for a car, but you need to put in a destination, which we struggled to find on their Chinese only maps.

You can also use a bus, but we didn't try this. Apple Maps appeared to give directions with buses (but oddly didn't with subways). You can use the 'transport cards' to pay and I think cash as well.

### Hotels

We booked all our hotels before we went via [booking.com](https://booking.com/) and [agoda.com](https://agoda.com/). And we created a spreadsheet listing the city and hotel each day, including what each hotel offered for breakfast, dinner, laundry, etc. Then, closer to the trip, I put them all in Google Calendar so we could know what to expect and easily show our driver the name. I highly recommend this approach as it is quick and easy to look up what's next and load a map or web page.

For the few hotels with laundry, it was always free and they had free detergent.

All of our hotels had western toilets and showers. A few had baths. All had free shampoo, soap, and bottled water. Very clean and modern.

### Power

Every power outlet we saw accepted both US two prong (type A) and the Asian two/three angled prongs (Type I)

### Language

Very few people spoke good English. Certainly some people did; however, we often used our guide to help with hotels. And we heavily used Baidu translate for other communication. All people at hotels and restaurants wanted to help us, so they were willing to make the conversation happen.

### Food

Every meal we had was excellent, no matter how cheap or expensive. The quality of the food is so vastly improved in the 30 years since we had last been there, it is hard to overstate. Ordering, we often had to tell a waiter that we needed ten minutes to decipher the menus, but it was pretty easy to order and pay, etc. And often they have dishes they are well known for on the first page, so we usually ordered that. Also, you don't have to tip unless it is an expensive place, and even then 10% would do.

### Costs

Here is a rough guide to what we spent for three adults per day (averaged over 20 days). Obviously, bigger cities cost more than smaller ones. I didn't divide it by three for a per person cost as that would be understating costs. For example, we often had two hotel rooms, but many hotels had rooms for three people, usually with a second bedroom.
