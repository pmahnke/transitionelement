  We started our trip with a visit to Woodstock Vermont to see Angela's Aunt Anne and Uncle Neil.  Luckily, Tessa, Brent's daughter was there. It was our first time meeting her.

We started our trip with a visit to Woodstock Vermont to see Angela's Aunt Anne and Uncle Neil.  Luckily, Tessa, Brent's daughter was there. It was our first time meeting her.

We had a few hours chatting and then went to dinner.  In the morning, Tessa had left for work, but we had breakfast and more catching up.

It was great to see everyone after nearly 30 years!
