Tonight I went to the Landmark Art Centre with Tanya and Paul to see Katherine Priddy.  Tanya and Paul had heard her before and invited Angela and me; however, Angela already agreed to do Bum Bum Train.

I met Tanya and Paul at the Anglers for a pre-show pint.  Then we headed over and the concert was great.

Even better, Paul drove me home.

Fun night.
