excerpt: |
  Ryan moved out to Clapham.

As parents you know the day will come. You also know it is the right thing for your child. But that doesn't make it any easier. We that day came today for Ryan. He moved to Clapham High Street with two university friends.

For him it should be closer to all his friends and a lot easier commute. It makes sense. And we are lucky. We liked living together, no really issues at all, unlike when I moved out. And we had Roo at home a lot more than more parents with Covid and him doing an internship in London, where we live for a year of Uni.

But I tell you, it is a very strange feeling to help him pack and help him move and then come home to a shell of a room. Far worse feeling than going to Uni.
