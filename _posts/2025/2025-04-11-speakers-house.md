Today we visited the Speaker's House inside Westminster Palace.  This was our second attempt.  The first time was before Covid and it was cancelled because of some emergency recall of Parliament.

The tour is done with a smaller group of less than 20 people. You are not allow to take any photos, except this one at the end of the tour.  You get to see just one floor, where the Speaker of the House has his office and rooms to entertain public figures and foreign visitors.

It is an actual house inside the Parliament buildings built around 1808.  It is lovely and ornate.  It use has changed over time from just a residence to an office as well.

If you have already seen the Houses of Parliament, it is worth the visit.
